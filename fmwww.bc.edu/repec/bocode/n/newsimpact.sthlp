{title:Description}

{p}{cmd:newsimpact} is for use after {cmd:arch}.
It plots the news impact curve, the response in the conditional variance, 
sigma^2(t),
to an innovation in the standardized error term, z(t-1).
When calculating the response in sigma^2(t) historical conditional variances 
(sigma^2(t-i), i > 0) are set to sigma^2 and historical error terms (z(t-i), i > 1)
are set to 1. The default value for sigma^2 is an estimate of the unconditional variance,
the mean of the estimated conditional variances. Finally error terms that enter in
the conditional variance formula are obtained as e(t) = sigma*z(t).

{p}Optionally saves the variables for the x axis (news) and y axis (response) of the graph.

{synoptset 15}{...}
{synopthdr:option}
{synoptline}

{synopt:{opt s:igma2(a)}}Use sigma^2 = a instead of the default. The
default is to set sigma^2 to the mean of the estimated conditional variances.

{synopt:{opt r:ange(b)}}Plot the news impact for z(t-1) = -b to +b instead of
the default z(t-1) = -2 to +2.

{synopt:{opt nog:raph}}Suppress display news impact graph.
