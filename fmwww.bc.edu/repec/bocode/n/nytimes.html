<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>nytimes</b> displays items from New York Times RSS feeds. It requires a
    connection to the internet.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>feed(</b><i>feedname</i><b>)</b> allows the user to specify which New York Times feed will
        be displayed. The default is the NYTimes.com Home Page (U.S.).  As of
        January 2011, other feed possiblities included: global home; news
        sites focusing on the world, Africa, the Americas, Asia Pacific,
        Europe, Middle East; US news feeds focusing on the US, education,
        politics, NY region, and energy environment; business news feeds
        focusing on global business, small business, economy, media and
        advertising, and your money; technology news feeds focusing on
        business-computing, internet, personal tech, and start-ups; sports
        news feeds focusing on sports, global sports, baseball, college
        basketball, college football, golf, hockey, pro basketball, pro
        football, soccer, and tennis; science news feeds focusing on science,
        environment, space, health research, nutrition, health care policy;
        and many more.  A complete list is available.
<p>
    <b>number(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> allows the user to specify how many feeds will displayed. The
        default is 5.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
    This command is a very crude RSS reader for feeds produced by the New
    York Times. It reports the headline, which is a hyperlink to the full
    text of the newspaper article, a brief article summary, and the date and
    time the article was published. Clicking on a headline will open up the
    article in your default web browser.
<p>
    If you want a number of feed items different than five, you may include
    the number as option. For example <b>nytimes, n(10)</b> will return the ten more
    recent items.  Normally, the Times feed only reports about a dozen items
    which creates an upper limit for the number of story summaries that will
    be displayed.
<p>
    <b>nytimes</b> doesn't work well for NYTimes.com blogs, as it is not set up to
    parse the ones that are routed through Feedburner. Some blog feeds will
    work, some will not.
<p>
    <b>nytimes</b> has no knowledge of whether or not you have seen a particular
    item before, so it will repeat items if you make multiple calls to it
    over a short period of time.
