<p>
    <i>model-type</i> can be any of logit, ologit, probit, and oprobit.
<p>
    <i>depvar</i> is the name of the dependent variable, and <i>varlist</i> is a varlist
    holding the name(s) of independent variables.
<p>
    Factor variables are allowed to the extend that the "i." construct can be
    used. Specification of interaction terms are, however, not allowed.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    The program estimates the (partial) correlation between the predictor
    variable(s) of a model and the latent variable, y*, assumed to underlie
    an discrete outcome. This correlation metric, developed by Breen,
    Karslon, and Holm (2011), can be used to draw cross-group comparisons
    based on non-linear probability models in a range situations met in
    applied research.  The program also calculates the standard error of the
    Fisher transformed correlations, obtained by the delta method (see Breen,
    Karlson, and Holm 2011).
<p>
    The derivations and interpretation of the correlation metric are given in
    Breen, Karlson, and Holm (2011). They show how logit and probit
    coefficients, often interpreted in terms of underlying linear regression
    coefficients identified up to scale, can be interpreted in terms of
    correlation coefficients.
<p>
    Let b denote a logit or probit coefficient of a predictor, x, in a logit
    or probit model with binary y as the outcome variable, hypothesized to be
    a discrete realization of an underlying propensity, y*:
<p>
                                  b = beta/s
<p>
    where beta is a regression coefficient from the linear model underlying
    the logit or probit model, and s is a scale parameter, which is a
    function of the conditional error variance of the underlying linear
    model. Breen, Karlson, and Holm (2011) show that b may be rewritten as
<p>
                        b = r/sqrt(1-r^2) * sd(w)/sd(x)
<p>
    where r is the correlation between the predictor variable, x, and the
    latent outcome, y*, assumed to underlie the binary variable y (a measure
    of the biserial correlation), sd(w) is a constant, the standard deviation
    of the standard normal or standard logitistic distribution (1 for the
    probit and pi/sqrt(3) for the logit), and sd(x) is the standard deviation
    of x. This decomposition of the logit or probit coefficient shows that
    logit coefficients may be decomposed into a scale invariant part (the
    square root of the ratio of explained relative to unexplained variation
    in y*) and a scale variant part, namely sd(x). Breen, Karlson, and Holm
    (2011) argue that in many situations met in social research, the scale
    invariant correlation metric implied in the decomposition is a natural
    choice for making comparisons across groups. Users should consult their
    article for a clarification of situations for which the metric will be
    suitable. Extensions to partial and multiple correlations and to ordered
    models are also given in Breen, Karlson, and Holm (2011).
<p>
    <b>nlcorr</b> be used either as a post-estimation command on the last estimated
    model, or as a stand alone command. Used as a post-estimation command the
    program shows the estimated coefficients of the last model rescaled to
    (partial) correlations. The main purpose of the program, however, is the
    comparison of these correlations between different samples. This purpose
    might be better achieved by using the program as a stand alone command.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>over(</b><i>varname </i>[<b>,</b><i> subpop </i>]<b>)</b> requests the estimation of the correlation for
        each independend variable over categories of the variable specified
        with over. Over is required when using <b>nlcorr</b> as stand alone program.
        The sub-option <b>subpop</b> is used only in connection specifying sampling
        weights (aka pweights). If the categories of the over variable refer
        to supgroups of the population of a complex sample, you should
        specify <b>subpop</b>. However, if the categories of the over variable refer
        to observations from different complex samples, you should not use
        <b>subpop</b>. If the over-variable is an identifier for different
        countries, you will very often not want to use <b>subpop</b>.
<p>
    <b>basecategory(</b><i>num</i><b>)</b> shows the results in terms of contrasts between each
        over category and the base category.
<p>
    <b>altout</b> returns the ratio of the (partial) correlation, r/sqrt(1-r^2), and
        the (conditional) standard deviation of x. This is useful for making
        the decomposition of the logit or probit coefficient.
<p>
    <b>clear</b> replaces the dataset in memory with the resultsset of <b>nlcorr</b>. This
        is useful for doing subsequent analysis on the group specific
        correlations.
