d 'MARKER': module to generate indicator variable marking desired sampledd marker creates a 0-1 variable markvar, such that markvar hasd value 1 if all values are present (not missing) for everyd variable in varlist and have	sensible non-zero weights ifd weights are specified and satisfy any if or in condition d specified, and 0 otherwise. The name of markvar defaults tod _marker, providing  that is not already in use. The main use ofd marker is to define samples so that  the results of commands thatd automatically ignore any observations with missing  values on anyd of the variables specified (e.g. regress) are comparable  withd the results of other commands that do not do this (e.g.d summarize). Once the	sample has been defined, it can bed specified by ... if markvar == 1 or even  more concisely by ...d if markvar dd Author: Nicholas J.
