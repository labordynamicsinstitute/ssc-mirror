Multivariate F tests
--------------------
<p>
      ^mvtest^ varlist1 [/varlist2 [/varlistn]] [, options ]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^mvtest^ tests linear hypotheses about the estimated parameters from the most
recently estimated multivariate regression using Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace
and Hotelling-Lawley's trace.  An optional transformation matrix to be applied
to the dependent variables prior to testing may be supplied.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^hyp^ prints the hypothesis sum of squares and cross products matrix.
<p>
^err^ prints the error sum of squares and cross products matrix.
<p>
^m(^elements^)^ specifies the transformation matrix for the dependent
   variables.  It uses the same format as an element by element matrix 
   definition (see [R] matrix).  The default is an identity matrix.
<p>
^norm^ normalizes the transformation matrix.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^mvtest^ performs multivariate F tests derived from the eigenvalues of the 
hypothesis and error sums of squares and cross products matrices.  The 
diagonal elements of these matrices correspond to the usual univariate F 
tests for regression and ANOVA.  If you supply a transformation matrix for 
the dependent variables, the hypothesis and error sums of squares and cross 
products matrices are transformed accordingly.  You can use the same 
transformation matrix to test several separate hypotheses by separating the 
list of variables to be tested with a slash '/' character.  Variables separated
only by spaces denote a set of variables to be tested jointly.

Examples
--------
<p>
mvreg dog cat rat : foo bar zoo_1 zoo_2 zoo_3
<p>
mvtest _cons
<p>
mvtest foo / bar, hyp err
<p>
mvtest foo / zoo_*, h m=(1 1 1 \ 1 -1 0 \ 1 0 -1)
