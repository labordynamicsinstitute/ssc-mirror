d 'NMF': module to perform matrix decomposition using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
d
d     The aim of nmf is to decompose matrix A into a lower-rank
d matrix approximation such that X â‰ˆ WH, where A, W and H are   
d made up of non-negative, real numbers. Missing values are
d permitted. If X is an n x m matrix, the dimensions of W and H   
d will be n x k and k x m, respectively, whereby k represents the
d rank of the decomposition. In many cases, a good    approximation
d for A may be achieved with k << rank(A).
