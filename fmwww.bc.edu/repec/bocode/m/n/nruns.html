<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>nruns</b> counts runs in a sequence of values given by <i>varname</i>, which may be
    either numeric or string, showing the successive occurrence of
    categories, such as <b>1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1</b> or <b>A A A A B B A A</b>.  A run ends
    when values change from one category to another or at the end of the
    sequence. Thus in these examples there are four and three runs
    respectively.
<p>
    <b>nruns</b> shuffles the sequence randomly a given number of times. It displays
    the simulated frequency and probability distributions under randomness of
    the number of runs possible with the same values and the probabilities of
    less than, the same number as, or more than that observed.
<p>
    To ensure reproducible results, set seed beforehand.  Options {p 4 8
    2}<b>nreps()</b> indicates the number of shuffles to be simulated.  The default
    is 10000.  {p 4 8 2}<b>saving()</b> indicates that results, meaning variables
    containing values, number of runs, frequencies and probabilities, should
    be saved to the specified file.  Examples {p 4 8 2}<b>. nruns sequence</b> Saved
