<b><u> Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>neoclassical</b> estimates a bivariate probit model with selection with coefficient
&gt; s 
re-scaled to facilitate cross-equation testing for equality.  It is termed 
neoclassical for it is a variant of the neoclassical education transitions fram
&gt; ework 
proposed in Lucas, Fucella, and Berends (2011).  Note that the first transition
&gt;  
appears in the second equation in the output.  Yet, in specifying the model the
&gt;  
temporally earlier transition is always regarded as the first transition.  The 
estimates are the re-scaled coefficients and the appropriate standard errors.  
&gt; Any 
subsequent statistical tests will use this second set of results.  A related co
&gt; mmand, 
retroclassical, estimates a neoclassical education transitions model while 
fixing the cross-equation error variance at zero.  This provides the result one
&gt;  would 
obtain by calibrating the coefficients across transitions, yet not accounting f
&gt; or 
selection.  Thus, it is a mid-way point between a neoclassical approach and the
&gt;  
classical approach.
<p>
    <b>Y1</b> is the outcome variable for the first transition--this is the
        selection equation for the second transition
<p>
    <b>TC1</b> contains the list of time constant variables; these should be common
        across the first and second equations.  The set of variables should
        be in quotes both times they are listed, and in the same exact order.
<p>
    <b>TV1Names</b> contains the names of the variables that have specific values
        for the first transition (and possibly different values for the
        second transition).  The set of variables should be in quotes
<p>
    <b>Exclusions</b> are those variables in the selection equation that are not in
        the equation for the second transition.  An explicit category is made
        for these variables to reinforce the necessity of having such
        variables to identify the selection process.  The set of variables
        should be in quotations, even if it is only 1 variable
<p>
    <b>Y1Independent</b> is the total number of independent variables in the first
        equation
<p>
    <b>Y2</b> is the outcome variable for the second transition--this is the last of
        the two transitions
<p>
    <b>TV2Names</b> contains the variables that have specific values for the second
        transition (and possibly different values for the first transition).
        These variables should be in quotes
<p>
    <b>Y2Independent</b> is the total number of independent variables in the second
        transition equation
<p>
    <b>deff</b> MUST be supplied.  It is a design effect and must be listed as 1.0
        if there is no design effect.
<p>
    <b>cluster</b> is a variable you may use to obtain Huber-White standard errors.
        This is optional.
