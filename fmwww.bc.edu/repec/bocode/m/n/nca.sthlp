{title:Description}
{pstd} {cmd: nca} performs a Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA). NCA identifies a necessary condition X for an outcome Y in datasets. NCA draws a ceiling line  Y = f(X) in an XY plot. The  line separates the area without observations (the area of 'no Y without X')  from the area with observations. NCA estimates several parameters including necessity effect size and its p value.

{title:Options}
{dlgtab:Main}
{phang}
{opt ceil:ings(string asis)} Ceilings to estimate.  The allowed ceilings are: {p_end}
{phang2} {bf: ce_fdh} requests {opt nca} to estimate a Ceiling Envelopment with Free Disposal Hull (default) {p_end}
{phang2} {bf: cr_fdh} requests {opt nca} to estimate a Ceiling Regression with Free Disposal Hull (default) {p_end}
{phang2} {bf: ce_vrs} requests {opt nca} to estimate a Ceiling Envelopment with Variable Returns to Scale {p_end}
{phang2} {bf: cr_vrs} requests {opt nca} to estimate a Ceiling Regression with Variable Returns to Scale {p_end}
{phang}
{opt test:rep(#)}   Number of permutation for the permutation test, the default is 0 and means that no permuation test is executed and, thus, no p-value is reported. {p_end}
{phang}
{opt sco:pe(numlist)}  a theoretical scope to be expressed in xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh  {p_end}
{phang}
{opt flipx}  forces {opt nca} to reverse the sign of all the conditions  {p_end}
{phang}
{opt flipy}  forces {opt nca} to reverse the sign of the outcome  {p_end}
{phang}
{opt cor:ner(numlist)}  an integer constant or a vector of integers indicating the corners to analyze, this option is equivalent to the combionations of {opt flipx} and {opt flipy}. If a single integer is specified by the user {opt nca} estimates the same corner for all the conditions. Users can specifiy a different corner for each condition. The default is 1 and means that neither the outcome nor the conditions are reversed in sign. {opt cor:ner(2)} is equivalent to {opt flipx}, {opt cor:ner(3)} is equivalent to {opt flipy} and {opt cor:ner(4)} is equivalent to {opt flipx flipy}.
{p_end}
{dlgtab:Bottlenecks table}
{phang}
{opt bottlenecks}[{bf:(}{it:numlist}{bf:)}]  the values of {it: outcome} to be used in the bottleneck table. numlist is optional and, when it is not specified, the values of the outcome to be displayed in the bottleneck table are controlled by {opt steps} and {opt stepsize}. If numlist is specified {cmd: nca} overrides {opt steps} and {opt stepsize}  {p_end}
{phang}
{opt steps(#)} number of intervals of equal length to divide the bottleneck table, the default is 10.  {p_end}
{phang}
{opt stepsize(numlist)} Step size for the bottleneck table. {p_end}
{phang}
{opt xbottlenecks(string)} and {opt ybot:tlenecks(string)} options for controlling the scale of the conditions in the bottleneck table. The possible options are{p_end}
{phang2} - {it: perc_range} : express the conditions in actual values. The default.{p_end}
{phang2} - {it: perc_range} : express the conditions in percentage of the range{p_end}
{phang2} - {it: perc_max} : express the conditions in percentage of the maximum{p_end}
{phang2} - {it: percentile} : express the conditions in percentiles{p_end}
{phang}
{opt cutoff(#)}  option for controlling how to display the x and y values that are outside the observed range. The possible options are.  {p_end}
{phang2} - 0 : NN (non necessary) and NA (not available) {p_end}
{phang2} - 1 : NN and highest observed values {p_end}
{phang2} - 2 : calculated values {p_end}
{dlgtab:Graph}
{phang}
{opt nograph}  Prevents {cmd: nca} from showing the graph. Estimation is considerably faster.  {p_end}
{phang}
{opt graphna:mes(stub)} prefix for the graph names. The suffix of the graphs is given by the condition they refer to.   {p_end}
{phang}
{opt nocombine}  Do not combine the graphs of each condition after the estimation.  {p_end}
{dlgtab:Display}
{phang}
{opt nosum:maries}  Prevents {cmd: nca} from displaying the ceiling summaries, this is useful for the users who are only interested in the bottlenecks table.  {p_end}
