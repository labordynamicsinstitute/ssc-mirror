<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>newey2</b> provides extensions to Stata's official <b>newey</b>.  It accepts panel as well
as time series data sets, and can instrument variables. For time series data
without instruments, <b>newey2</b> behaves the same as <b>newey</b>.
<p>
<b>neweyvif</b> works like Stata's official <b>vif</b> but can run after <b>newey</b>, as well as
after <b>newey2</b> without instrumented variables. It computes variance inflation
factors; see help vif. <b>neweydmexog</b> is an extension of the unofficial Stata
command <b>dmexog</b> that runs after <b>newey2</b> with instrumental variables. It tests for
consistency of OLS after an instrumental variables regression; see <b>net search</b>
<b>dmexog</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b>aweight</b>s are allowed in <b>newey2</b>; see help weights. They are not allowed in
<b>neweydmexog</b>.
<p>
<b>newey</b> shares the features of all estimation commands; see help est.
<p>
<p>
The syntax of predict following <b>newey2</b> is
<p>
        <b>predict</b> [<i>type</i>] <i>newvarname</i> [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>] [<b>,</b> [ <b>xb</b> | <b>residuals</b> |
                <b>stdp</b> ] ]
<p>
<b>xb</b>, <b>resid</b>, and <b>stdp</b> are available both in and out of sample; type "<b>predict</b> <i>...</i>
<b>if e(sample)</b> <i>...</i>" if wanted only for the estimation sample.
<p>
<b>newey2</b> produces Newey-West standard errors for coefficients estimated by OLS or
2SLS.  The error structure is assumed to be heteroskedastic and possibly
autocorrelated up to some lag.
<p>
For panel data sets, <b>newey2</b> computes pooled OLS or 2SLS estimates; it does not
implement panel models such as fixed or random effects.<b>  newey2</b> handles missing
observations differently for time series and panel data sets. Consider the
example of a time series data set containing gaps, which is then recast using
<b>tsset</b> as a panel data set with one group. <b>newey</b> and <b>newey2</b> will not run on the
time series version without <b>force</b>; with <b>force</b> they treat available observations
as equally spaced.  After the set is cast as a panel, <b>newey2</b> will run without <b>,</b>
<b>force</b>, and will assume zero serial correlation with missing observations.
<p>
For both time series and panel data sets, <b>newey2</b> can instrument variables using
the same syntax as<b> ivreg</b>; see help ivreg. In computing the Newey-West sum for
the second-stage regression, <b>newey2</b> uses residuals e=Y-XB where X contains all
actual, not instrumented, values.
<p>
If <b>lag(0)</b> is specified, the variance estimates produced by <b>newey2</b> are the
Huber/White/sandwich robust variance estimates calculated by <b>regress, robust</b> or
<b>ivreg, robust</b>; see help regress or help ivreg.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options for newey2</u></b>
<p>
<b>lag(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> is not optional; it specifies the maximum lag to consider in the
    autocorrelation structure.
<p>
<b>t(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies the variable recording the time of each observation.  If
    this option is not used, t must already have been set using <b>tis</b> or <b>tsset</b>;
    see help tis and help tsset.  If the data set is a time series rather than
    a panel and observations are not equally spaced in time, you must use the
    <b>force</b> option.
<p>
<b>i(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies the variable recording the "group," "panel," or
    "independent unit" of each observation.  <b>newey2</b> will treat the data set as
    a panel set if this option is used, or if the set has already been
    configured as such with <b>iis</b> or <b>tsset</b>.
<p>
For time series, <b>force</b> specifies that estimation is to be forced even though
    <b>t()</b> shows the data not to be equally spaced.  <b>newey2</b> will estimate the
    model assuming the lags based on the data ordered by <b>t()</b> are appropriate.
    <b>force</b> has no effect for panel data sets.
<p>
<b>noconstant</b> specifies that no intercept is to be included in the model.
<p>
<b>level(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence intervals;
    see help level.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options for </u></b><b><u>predict</u></b>
<p>
<b>xb</b>, the default, calculates the linear prediction.
<p>
<b>residuals</b> calculates the residuals of the linear prediction.
<p>
<b>stdp</b> calculates the standard error of the linear prediction.
<p>
