<b><u>Title</u></b>
    <b>nopomatch</b> -- Decomposition of Nopo (2008)
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
        <b>nopomatch</b> <i>matchvar</i> [<i>matchvar(s)</i>] [if] <b>,</b> outcome(<i>varname</i>) by(<i>varname</i>)
                 [<i>options</i>]
<p>
<b><u>Parameters</u></b>
      <i>matchvar(s):</i>                   list of variables used to match
                                      observations of the groups defined by
                                      <i>by()</i>.
      <i>outcome:</i>                       outcome for which the gap will be
                                      computed. (e.g.: wage)
      <i>by:</i>                            dummy (0/1) that discriminates the
                                      sample to perform the computation of
                                      the gap. (e.g.: gender).

<b><u>Description</u></b>
    <b>nopomatch</b> -- module to decompose the gap in an outcome between two groups
    using matching, following the methodology developed by Nopo (2008).
    <b>nopomatch</b> performs the matching, computes the gap decomposition and
    provides the standard deviation of the unexplained component of the gap.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
        +------+
    ----+ Main +-------------------------------------------------------------
    <b>sd</b> computes standard deviations of the unexplained components of the gap.
        Note that the usage of this option substancially increases
        significantly the computation time.
<p>
    <b>replace</b> deletes the _match and _supp variables previously created (if
        any).
<p>
    <b>reportby(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> repeats the command for each group of observations of
        each category of <i>varname</i>.
<p>
    <b>fact(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies the use of a weighting factor variable (frequency
        weight) in the data.
<p>
    <b>filename(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> creates an output STATA file (<i>string.dta</i>) with the
        results of the decomposition.
<p>
<b><u>Output</u></b>
<p>
A typical output of the <b>nopomatch</b> module looks like this:

****************************************************
*****  Gap in <i>matchvar(s)</i> decomposition 
****************************************************
<p>
      D = #     is the total gap, the difference between averages in the
                  outcome-variable of the comparing groups. It is expressed
                  as a percentage of the average of outcome-variable for the
                  group in which by-variable=0
      D0= #     is the unexplained part of the gap.
      DM= #     is the part of the gap that can be explained by the
                  differences in characteristics between two groups of the
                  individuals with by-variable=1, that are in and out of the
                  common support of the variables defined by
                  <i>match-variable(s)</i>
      DF= #     is the part of the gap that can be explained by the
                  differences in characteristics between two groups of the
                  individuals with by-variable=0, that are in and out of the
                  common support of the variables defined by
                  <i>match-variable(s)</i>
      DX= #     is the part of the gap that can be explained by differences
                  in the distribution of characteristics of the two groups
                  discriminated by by-variable in the common support of the
                  variables defined by <i>match-variable(s)</i>
****************************************************
      percM= #  is the percentage of the individuals with <i>by-variable</i>=1 that
                  are in the common support of the variables defined by
                  <i>match-variable(s)</i>
      percF= #  is the percentage of the individuals with <i>by-variable</i>=0 that
                  are in the common support of the variables defined by
                  <i>match-variable(s)</i>
