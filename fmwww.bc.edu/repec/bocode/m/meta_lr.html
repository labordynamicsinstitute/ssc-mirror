<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
        <b>meta_lr</b> does mainly two things: it can do stratified meta-analysis of i
&gt; ndividual estimates 
        <i>theta1</i> and <i>theta2</i> by <i>stratavariables</i>, save the stratified pooled estima
&gt; tes and 
        their confidence intervals in new data set and draw them in one graph; 
&gt; if stratified variables are not
        given, <b>meta_lr</b> draw <i>theta1</i> and <i>theta2</i> and their confidence interval by 
&gt; individual study
        in one graph, with or without weighting. Combined meta-analysis results
&gt;  are shown in star.
<p>
        This command is mainly used to draw graph in diagnostic test.The user p
&gt; rovides the effect estimate as thetas 
        (e.g., log positive likelihood ratio and log negative likelihood ratio)
&gt; . Likewise, the user provides the 
        standard error of thetas. 
        
        Commands meta and metareg must be installed before using this command.
<p>
<b><u>options for stratified analysis</u></b>
<p>
        <b>stratify</b> must be given when do the stratified analysis. Meanwhile, at l
&gt; east one <i>stratavariable</i> must be given.
<p>
        <b>fix</b> indicates statified meta-analysis using fixed model. Default is ran
&gt; dom effect model. 
<p>
        <b>eform</b> is the same option as in meta. It requests that the output of str
&gt; atified meta-analysis
        is exponentiated. When this option is chosen, option <b>xscale(log)</b> is sug
&gt; gested to use. 
        
        <b>ylab</b> gives labels on y axis. These labels are the strata variables. 
        
        <b>graphoption</b> the following graph options of STATA 8 can be used in this 
&gt; command. <b>symbol() msize()</b>
        <b>mcolor() xscale() xline() xlabel() blpattern() blcolor() ytitle() xtitl</b>
<b>&gt; e() scheme()</b>
<p>
<b><u>options for not stratified analysis</u></b>
<p>
        Option <b>stratify</b> must not be given.
<p>
        <b>id(strvar)</b> is a character variable which is used to label the studies. 
&gt; A string variable must be given.
        
        <b>combine</b> provide the combined estimates of <i>theta1</i> and <i>theta2</i> with their 
&gt; confidence intervals. In graph, they 
        are shown in star with two vertical lines to show the combined point es
&gt; timates. <b>combine</b> can be chosen together with 
        <b>fix</b> which means that fixed meta-analysis model is used, random model is
&gt;  the default one.
        
        <b>weighting</b> gives individual study weights. If <b>fix</b> is chosen, weights are
&gt;  reverse of variance of <i>theta1</i> and
        <i>theta2</i>. If <b>fix</b> is not chosen, weights are 1/(tau^2 + variance).
        
        <b>fix</b> define that combined estimates are obtained from fixed meta-analysi
&gt; s and weighting is reverse of variance. Default 
        is that combined estimates are from random effect model and weights are
&gt;  1/(tau^2 + variance). 
        
        <b>graphoption</b> the same as for stratified analysis.
        
<b><u>Required input variables</u></b>
<p>
        <b>theta1</b>   the first effect estimate (for example log negative likelihood
&gt;  ratio)
        <b>se_theta1</b>  the corresponding standard error
<p>
<p>
        <b>theta2</b>   the second effect estimate (for example log positive likelihoo
&gt; d ratio)
        <b>se_theta2</b>  the corresponding standard error
        
        <b>theta1</b> and <b>theta2</b> can be the same effect estimates. This means that str
&gt; atified meta-analysis will 
        be done only on one effect estimate and the graph only shows for one es
&gt; timate. Hence, this command also can be
        used in meta-analysis of randomised controlled trails which will show t
&gt; he similar graph as meta. However
        <b>meta_lr</b> provide more options, with or without combine, weighting and mo
&gt; re graph options. The disadvantage is 
        that the user needs to type the same theta and its corresponding standa
&gt; rd error twice.
        
        <b>stratavariable</b> are the stratified variables. They must be discrete or b
&gt; inary variables. These variables are re-grouped
        before drawing the graph. For example, if the user has a variable calle
&gt; d test which can be 0, 0.5 or 1. This variable 
        is re-grouped to 1, 2 and 3. This change is made in order to label y ax
&gt; is. But the user's data set will not be changed
        at all.
