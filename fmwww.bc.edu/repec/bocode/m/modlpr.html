<b><u>Estimate long memory in a timeseries via Modified Log-Periodogram Regression</u></b>

    <b>modlpr</b> is for use with time-series data.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before
    using <b>modlpr</b>; see help <b>tsset</b>.  <b>modlpr</b> supports the <b>by</b> prefix, which may be
    used to operate on each time series in a panel. Alternatively, the <b>if</b>
    qualifier may be used to specify a single time series in a panel.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>modlpr</b> computes a modified form of the Geweke/Porter-Hudak (GPH, 1983)
    estimate of the long memory (fractional integration) parameter, <i>d</i>, of a
    timeseries, proposed by Phillips (1999a, 1999b). If a series exhibits long
    memory, it is neither stationary (I[0]) nor is it a unit root (I[1])
    process; it is an I(<i>d</i>) process, with <i>d</i> a real number. However,
    distinguishing unit-root behavior from fractional integration may be
    problematic, given that the GPH estimator is inconsistent against <i>d</i>&gt;1
    alternatives.
<p>
    This weakness of the GPH estimator (see <b>gphudak^</b>) is solved by Phillips'
    Modified Log Periodogram Regression estimator, in which the dependent
    variable is modified to reflect the distribution of <i>d</i> under the null
    hypothesis that <i>d</i>=1. The estimator gives rise to a test statistic for <i>d</i>=1
    which is a standard normal variate under the null. Phillips suggests (p.11)
    that deterministic trends should be removed from the series before
    application of the estimator. By default, a linear trend is extracted from
    the series.  This may be suppressed with the <b>notrend</b> option.
<p>
    A choice must be made of the number of harmonic ordinates to be included in
    the spectral regression. The regression slope estimate is an estimate of
    the slope of the series' power spectrum in the vicinity of the zero
    frequency; if too few ordinates are included, the slope is calculated from
    a small sample. If too many are included, medium and high-frequency
    components of the spectrum will contaminate the estimate. A choice of
    root(T), or <b>power</b> = 0.5 is often employed. To evaluate the robustness of
    the estimates, a range of power values (from 0.4 - 0.75) is commonly
    calculated as well.  <b>modlpr</b> uses the default power of 0.5. A <i>numlist</i> of
    powers may be given.
<p>
    The command displays the d estimate, number of ordinates, conventional
    standard error and P-value, as well as the test statistic (<b>zd</b>) for the test
    of <i>d</i>=1, and its p-value. These values are returned in a matrix, e(modlpr),
    formatted for display.<b>  ereturn list</b> for details. If <b>modlpr</b> is used in a
    panel context and the returned results are to be saved, the <b>if</b> qualifier
    should be used rather than the <b>by</b> prefix to loop over panels.
