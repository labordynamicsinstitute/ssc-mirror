<b><u>Creation of dummy variables and summary table for multiple response data</u></b>
<p>
        <b>mrdum</b> <i>varlist</i> [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>]<b>,</b> <b><u>s</u></b><b>tub(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> [<b><u>res</u></b><b>ponses(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b>
              <b><u>lab</u></b><b>els</b>[<b>(</b><i>valuelabelname</i><b>)</b>]]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
For general use, <b>mrdum</b> searches across <i>varlist</i> for integer codes and creates
corresponding binary dummy variables. Each dummy is equal to 1 if the integer
code was found anywhere in <i>varlist</i>, 0 if not, and missing if all of <i>varlist</i> is
missing. It also displays a table summarizing the results.
<p>
This program was created specifically to deal with survey questions wherein the
respondent can give multiple responses to a single question (e.g. "Check all
that apply"). Sometimes these data are coded as a series of variables with the
responses entered in the order that the respondent indicated them.  Often,
however, it is useful to have instead a set of binary dummy variables that
indicate whether the respondent indicated a particular response regardless of
the order in which it was indicated.
<p>
If you are interested in the order that responses were indicated, see Eric
Zbinden's <b>zb_qrm</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>stub(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> specifies a stub for the resulting dummy variables. The stub
    should be short enough for all the complete names to be legal. This is a
    required option.
 
<b>responses(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> allows the user to specify exactly which responses (integer
    codes) are of interest. If this option is not specified, the command will
    assume that the responses are coded from 1 to <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of
    variables in <i>varlist</i>.
<p>
<b>labels</b> has two possible syntaxes. With no argument, this option displays any
    value labels attached rather than the numeric codes. Any or all of <i>varlist</i>
    can be labelled. This option can also take a previously defined value label
    name as an argument.

<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
        . mrdum f4m1-f4m7, stub(q4) lab
            This produces seven dummy variables for responses coded 1-7
            plus a dummy to indicate which cases are completely missing
            (if there are any that are completely missing). The table
            produced will show value labels rather than numeric codes.
<p>
        . mrdum f4m1-f4m7, stub(q4) res(1/4,7)
            This produces four dummy variables for responses coded 1-4,
            one dummy for responses coded 7, and one to indicate which
            cases are completely missing.
<p>
        . lab define colour 1 "red" 2 "blue" 3 "green"
        . mrdum f4m1-f4m3, stub(q4) labels(colour)
