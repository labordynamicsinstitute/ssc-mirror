You must {cmd:tsset} yourdata before using {cmd:mizrachl2}; see help {help tsset}.{p} {it:varname} may contain time-series operators; see help {help varlist}.{title:Description}{p}{cmd:mizrachl2} calculates a forecast comparison test proposed byMizrach (1995). Given two competing predictions, a positive definite, robust statistic for comparing the predictions' accuracy may be calculated.{p}{title:Options}{p 0 4}{cmd:k} specifies the maximum order of the lag to be used in calculating the long-run variance of the difference series from its autocovariancefunction. If it is not provided, the maximum lag order will be calculated as a function of the sample size.{title:Examples}{p 8 12}{inp:.} {stata "use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/macro/barclaymonthly.dta,clear":use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/macro/barclaymonthly.dta,clear}{p 8 12}{inp:. mizrachl2 bbjpy1f bbjpy2f}{p 8 12}{inp:. mizrachl2 bbjpy1f bbjpy2f, k(10)}{p 8 12}{inp:. mizrachl2 D.bbjpy1f D.bbjpy2f if tin(1987m12,1996m12), k(4)}{title:References}Bruce Mizrach, "Forecast Comparison in L2", Rutgers University Working Paper      1995-24       {title:Acknowledgements}This routine is a translation of a Fortran program kindly provided byBruce Mizrach.
