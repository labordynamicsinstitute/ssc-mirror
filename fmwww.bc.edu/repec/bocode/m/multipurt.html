    <b>multipurt</b> -- Running 1st and 2nd generation panel unit root tests for
                 multiple variables and lags
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
    <b>multipurt</b> <i>varname</i> [<i>if</i>] [<i>in</i>] [<b>,</b> <b>lags(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b>]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>multipurt</b> runs the Maddala and Wu (1999) as well as the Pesaran (2007)
    panel unit root tests for multiple variables and lags. This is not a new
    command for these panel unit root tests but a convenient tool using the
    existing xtfisher (if installed) and pescadf (if installed) commands
    written by Scott Merryman and Piotr Lewandowski respectively. The maximum
    number of variable or residual series to be tested is set to 9.
<p>
    The <b>multipurt</b> routine implements these two panel unit root tests building
    on Dickey-Fuller and Augmented Dickey-Fuller regressions for models with
    and without a trend term.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Details</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>Maddala and Wu (1999)</b> test assumes/allows for heterogeneity in the
    autoregressive coefficient of the Dickey-Fuller regression and ignores
    cross-section dependence in the data. Building on the Fisher-principle it
    constructs a chi-squared statistic, whereby the p-values of
    country-specific (A)DF tests are transformed into logs and summed across
    panel members. Multiplied by -2 this sum is then distributed chi-squared
    with 2N degrees of freedom under the null of nonstationarity in all panel
    members/series.
<p>
    The <b>Pesaran (2007)</b> CIPS test allows for assumes/allows for heterogeneity
    in the autoregressive coefficient of the Dickey-Fuller regression and
    allows for the presence of a single unobserved common factor with
    heterogeneous factor loadings in the data. The statistic is constructed
    from the results of panel-member-specific (A)DF regressions where
    cross-section averages of the dependent and independent variables
    (including the lagged differences to account for serial correlation) are
    included in the model (referred to as CADF regressions). The averaging of
    the group-specific results follows the procedure in the Im, Pesaran and
    Shin (2003) test.  Under the null of nonstationarity the test statistic
    has a non-standard distribution.
<p>
    The <b>pescadf</b> command used in this procedure will report an error message
    if there are gaps in the data. However, unless the number of observations
    missing in this fashion is large the Z-tbar test statistic can still be
    computed.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Required options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>lags(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> identifies the maximum number of lagged differences to be
    included in the group-specific Augmented Dickey Fuller regressions. The
    routine begins by omitting these augmentations (Dickey-Fuller regression:
    lags(<i>0</i>)), which are intended to capture the serial correlation in the
    data.

<b><u>Example</u></b>
<p>
Download FAO production data (zipped file) for the agriculture sector in 128
countries (1961-2002, unbalanced). See Eberhardt and Teal (2010) for details
on data construction and deflation.  Cross-country growth empirics are
reviewed in Eberhardt and Teal (2011).
<p>
Variables used in illustration: ly log value-added per worker, ltr log
tractors per worker, llive log livestock per worker, lf log fertilizer per
worker, ln log land per worker (all with reference to the agricultural
sector). Note that the dataset is quite large, such that it may be advisable
(but not required) to increase the memory and matsize <i>before</i> loading the data
(e.g.  .set mem 100m,  .set matsize 8000). The routine also works with a much
more modest memory and matsize allocation.
<p>
Once the dataset is loaded into the program, set the panel dimensions: time
    variable - year, country identifier - clist2.
    .tsset clist2 year
<p>
Investigate stationarity in the production function variables. We limit the
    analysis to the first 20 countries (results for the full N=128 sample -if
    !missing(clist2) &amp; sample==1- can take several minutes to compute)
    .multipurt ly ltr llive lf ln if clist2&lt;21 &amp; sample==1, lags(4)

This routine uses some clever practices for data handling taken from Damiaan
Persyn's xtwest (if installed) command.  It furthermore employs the panel
unit root tests implemented in Stata by Scott Merryman xtfisher (if
installed) and Piotr Lewandowski pescadf (if installed) and also uses some of
these authors' data handling routines. Users should refer to these help files
for more details and acknowledge the authors of the commands. Thanks to Kit
Baum for help and support. Any errors are of course my own.
