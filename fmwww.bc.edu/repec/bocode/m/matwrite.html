<b><u>MAT-file export plugin</u></b>
<p>
    <b>matwrite</b> [<i>anything</i>] <b>using</b> <i>filename</i> [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>] <b>[,</b>
    <b><u>mat</u></b><b>rix(</b><i>namelist</i><b>)</b> <b>replace</b> <b>]</b>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>matwrite</b> allows you to export data in the MATLAB MAT-file format from
    within Stata. Variables as specified in <i>anything</i> can be exported as
    column vectors, and groups of variables can be exported as matrices.
    Stata matrices as specified in <b><u>mat</u></b><b>rix(</b><i>namelist</i><b>)</b> are exported as matrices.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <i>anything</i> can contain a <i>varlist</i>, as well as facilitating the export of a
        group of variables as a matrix. <b>matwrite</b> identifies user specified
        matrices by the matrix name being followed by a <i>varlist</i> contained
        within square brackets: <i>matrixname[varlist]</i>. For example, income[y*]
        will export a matrix named "income" which contains all variables
        which begin with "y".
<p>
    <b><u>mat</u></b><b>rix(</b><i>namelist</i><b>)</b> specifies the Stata matrices that will be exported by
        <b>matwrite</b>. If any of the specified matrices do not exist, a warning
        message will be displayed, although an error will not be raised.
<p>
<b><u>Notes</u></b>
<p>
    If <i>anything</i> is not specified, all variable in the open Stata dataset will
    be exported as column vectors. Similarly, if <b><u>mat</u></b><b>rix(</b><i>namelist</i><b>)</b> is not
    specified, all Stata matrices will be exported.
<p>
    Missing values in both variables and matrices are recoded as positive
    infinity in MATLAB.
<p>
    String variables can not be exported as this is not allowed by the Stata
    plugin interface.
<p>
    Variable names and matrix names can not be longer than 19 characters as
    this is not supported by the Level 4 MAT-File format. A future version of
    <b>matwrite</b> will support the Level 5 MAT-File format which does not impose
    this restriction.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    . matwrite using c:\matlabfile,replace
<p>
    . matwrite var1 var2 var3 using c:\matlabfile, mat(mat1 mat2) replace
<p>
    . matwrite var1 if var2&lt;=10 using c:\matlabfile, mat(mat1 mat2) replace
<p>
    . matwrite mymat1[var*] var1 var2 using c:\matlabfile, mat(mat1 mat2)
    replace
