Multivariate and univariate odd ratios (logistic regression)
-------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
 ^mulogit^ depvar indepvar1 indepvar2 ... indepvarp [^if^ exp] 
<p>
Generates multivariate and univariate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for variables in ^varlist^.  The
resulting univariate and multivariate ORs are appended to the
rightside of the data editor, so that they can be cut and pasted
into other graphics packages or publication tables.
<p>
The purpose of ^mulogit^ is to write the ORs and 95% CIs
limits as new variable values in the data editor, and then generate
plots of the ORs and CIs using the new variables.  
<p>
The twoway rcap graph of Version 10 is first used to generate
a separate plot for multivariate ORs and CIs, then a separate
plot for univariate ORs and CIs.  The variable names (value labels)
in the plots are appended with one of the three labels
designating the significance level for each variable:
<p>
* - p&lt;0.05
** - p&lt;0.01
*** - p&lt;0.001
<p>
The following plots are saved to disk:
<p>
^multuniv.gph^ - a twoway rcap plot of both the multivariate
and univariate ORS and CIs   
<p>
^mult.gph^ - a twoway rcap plot of multivariate ORs and CIs
<p>
^univ.gph^ - a twoway rcap plot of univariate ORs and CIs  
<p>
Finally, the ^combine^ graphics command is used to combine
the separate multivariate and univariate plots into a single
graph.  The ^ycommon^ option for ^combine^ is also employed
to display the same scale (ranges) of multivariate and
univariate ORs and CIs.
