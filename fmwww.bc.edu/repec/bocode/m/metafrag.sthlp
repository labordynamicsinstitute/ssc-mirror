{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt metafrag} is an extension of the fragility index for single studies with a binary outcome (Walsh et al. 2014) to meta-analysis (Atal et al. 2019). The fragility 
index for meta-analysis is defined as the minimum number of patients from one or more trials included in the meta-analysis for which a modification 
of the event status (ie, changing events to non-events, or non-events to events) would change the statistical significance of the pooled treatment effect (Atal et al. 2019). 
As such, a fragility index score of zero indicates that no modification of the event status is necessary to elicit a statistically non-significant pooled treatment effect. 
Conversely, a large fragility index score indicates that many modifications to the event status are required to change a statistically significant pooled effect to non-significant 
(and thus, the results may be considered more robust). 

{pstd}
{opt metafrag} is a post estimation command for {helpb meta_esize:meta esize}, thereby capitalizing on the comprehensive list of options available in official Stata's {helpb meta:meta} suite for computing effect sizes for binary outcomes.

  

{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:eform} reports exponentiated effect sizes and transforms their respective confidence intervals, whenever applicable. 
By default, the results are displayed in the metric declared with meta esize such as log odds-ratios and log risk-ratios. 
{cmd:eform} affects how results are displayed, not how they are estimated and stored.

{p 4 8 2}
{opt forest}[{cmd:(}{it:{help meta_forestplot:forestplot}}{cmd:)}] displays a forest plot of the studies after modification to the events and non-events of included studies,
to move the pooled effect from statistically significant to non-significant (the user can set the level that "significance" represents using the {cmd:level} option 
in {helpb meta_esize:meta esize}). Specifying {cmd:forest} without options uses the default {help meta_forestplot:forestplot} settings (with only the column headers modified).
Studies that have event modifications are highlighted in blue (when events are added) and red (when events are subtracted).



{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{opt metafrag} produces results consistent with those of the R package {browse "https://github.com/iatal/fragility_ma":fragility_ma} 
and related website {browse "http://www.clinicalepidemio.fr/fragility_ma/"}. However, there are some differences 
between the software programs; (1) Stata's {helpb meta_esize:meta esize} command does not support the combination of random effects with 
the Mantelâ€“Haenszel method (see {help meta_esize##remethod}), whereas {browse "https://github.com/iatal/fragility_ma":fragility_ma}, which utilizes the 
{browse "https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/meta/versions/4.9-7/topics/metabin":metabin}
package for computing pooled treatment effects, does support this combination; (2) Stata's {helpb meta_esize:meta esize} handles zero cells somewhat differently than 
{browse "https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/meta/versions/4.9-7/topics/metabin":metabin}, possibly leading to slightly different results between software packages; 
and (3) when there are ties between studies in the computed maximum (minimum) confidence level at any iteration, {browse "https://github.com/iatal/fragility_ma":fragility_ma} reports 
the fragility index that includes the modifications to all tied studies. Conversely, {cmd:metafrag} reports both the fragility index for each 
iteration in the loop where {it:any} event modification occurs, as well as the total number of modifications if there are ties.

{pstd} The results indicate that the fragility index is 28 and that 2 trials were modified -- with the first adding 8 events to Group 1 and subtracting 9 events from Group 2, 
and the second adding 11 events to Group 1 {p_end}



{title:Acknowledgments}

{p 4 4 2}
I thank John Moran for advocating that I write this package. I also wish to thank Ignacio Atal for his support in testing the results reported by {cmd:metafrag}
to assess their consistency with his R package {cmd:fragility_ma} and website {browse "http://www.clinicalepidemio.fr/fragility_ma/"}. Finally, I wish to thank
Houssein Assaad at StataCorp for providing details of how Stata and R differ in their respective computations for meta analyses.
