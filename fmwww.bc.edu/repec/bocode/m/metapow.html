<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>metapow</b> implements an approach to estimating the power of a newly
    simulated study(ies), generated using the program metasim. It can also
    estimate the power of the updated meta-analysis including the new study.
    The power estimates are then stored in a file called temppow2 within the
    working directory.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
        +------+
    ----+ Main +-------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>n(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> relates to the number of patients in the new study. If
        simulating a new clinical trial, then this specifies the number of
        patients in the control group. If simulating a new diagnostic
        accuracy study then <b>n</b> is the number of diseased patients when using
        sensitivity and specificity as the outcome measure of accuracy, or
        the number of positive test results if using the diagnostic odds
        ratio (DOR).
<p>
    <b>nit(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> is the number of simulations that are run on which the
        estimated poweris based. The larger the number specified the more
        accurate the estimate will be, but the longer the analysis will take.
 
    <b>type(</b><i>clinical/diagnostic</i><b>)</b> specifies the type of new study that the user
        would like to simulate; either a 2-arm clinical trial or a diagnostic
        test accuracy study.
<p>
    <b>pow(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> specifies the value used as a cut-off in determining the
        power. One or two values can be inputted.  The value/s represents
        different things depending on the option chosen for <i>inference</i>.
<p>
        +----------+
    ----+ Optional +---------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>measure(</b><i>or/rr/rd/nostandard/dor/ss</i><b>)</b> specifies the outcome measure used in
        the meta-analysis to pool the results. The odds ratio (<i>or</i>), relative
        risk (<i>rr</i>), risk difference (<i>rd</i>) and unstandardised mean difference
        (<i>nostandard</i>) can only be used when simulating a new clinical study.
        The diagnostic odds ratio (<i>dor</i>) and sensitivity and specificity (<i>ss</i>)
        can only be used when simulating a new diagnostic accuracy study. The
        default for a clinical <b>type</b> study with 4 variables entered into the
        <i>varlist</i> is relative risk (<i>rr</i>, the default for a clinical <b>type</b> study
        with 6 variables entered into the<i> varlist</i> is unstandardised mean
        difference (<i>nostandard</i> and the default for a diagnostic <b>type</b> study is
        sensitivity and specificity (<i>ss</i>).
 
<p>
    <b>inference(</b><i>ciwidth/pvalue/lci/uci</i><b>)</b> defines the approach to inference used
        to calculate power. The default is the confidence interval width
        (<i>ciwidth</i>). This counts the number of times that the confidence
        interval width of the estimate/s from the updated meta-analysis (i.e.
        with the simulated study(ies) included) is less than the specified
        value/s. This option can be used regardless of the measure of
        accuracy. Two other approaches to inference available are <i>lci</i> and
        <i>uci</i>. These will count the number of times that the lower or upper
        confidence interval is higher or lower than a given value
        respectively. The <i>lci</i> option can be used regardless of the measure of
        accuracy. However, the <i>uci</i> option is currently only available when
        working with clinical trial data and not diagnostic data. A final
        option only available when using clinical trial data is the <i>pvalue</i>.
        This counts the number of times that a p-value is significant to a
        specified level. When using sensitivity and specificity two values
        may be inputted into <i>pow</i> for <i>ciwidth</i> and <i>lci</i>.  This will instruct the
        program to count the number of times that the confidence interval
        widths for both sensitivity and specificity are less than their
        respective specified values. These must be given in the order
        sensitivity and specificity to be calculated correctly. In order to
        use the <i>ciwidth</i> or <i>lci</i> options for just sensitivity or just
        specificity the <i>sos</i> option should be used in addition to this option.
<p>
    <b>p(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> if simulating a new clinical study then this is the estimated
        event rate in the control group in the new study. When simulating a
        new diagnostic study this is the estimated probability of being
        diseased given a positive result in the new study. When this option
        is not specified by the user, the program will calculate this value
        by averaging the probabilities across the studies included in the
        dataset memory. Note that <b>p</b> is only relevant in the diagnostic
        framework when using the diagnostic odds ratio (<i> dor</i>) as the option
        in <b>measure</b>.
<p>
    <b>r(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> is the ratio of patients in the control group to the treatment
        group when simulating a new clinical study. When simulating a new
        diagnostic accuracy study this is the ratio of diseased to healthy
        people if using sensitivity and specificity and the ratio of positive
        to negative results if using the DOR (default 1).
<p>
    <b>studies(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> specifies the number of new studies to be simulated
        (default 1).  When more than one are specified they are all assumed
        to have the same sample size.
<p>
    <b>model(</b><i>fixed/fixedi/random/randomi/bivariate</i><b>)</b> defines the type of model
        used to meta-analyse the pre-existing data. The default is the fixed
        effect Mantel-Haenszel method (<i>fixed</i>) unless the outcome measure is
        the nonstandardised mean difference in which case the default is the
        inverse variance method (<i>fixedi</i>).  The (<i>fixedi</i>) option specifies a
        fixed effect model using the inverse variance method.  The (<i>random</i>)
        option uses the random effect DerSimonian &amp; Laird method, taking the
        estimate for heterogeneity from the Mantel-Haenszel method. The
        (<i>randomi</i>) option specifies a random effects model using the method of
        DerSimonian and Laird, with the estimate of heterogeneity being taken
        from the inverse-variance fixed-effect model. All of the above
        options call on the <b>metan</b> command within the program. The final
        option is the bivariate random effects model (<i>bivariate</i>). This method
        calls on a combination of the <b>metandi</b> and <b>midas</b> commands. It may only
        be specified when simulating a new diagnostic accuracy study.
 
    <b>npow(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> recalculates the power using a newly specified value for
        the same <i>inference</i> without having to re-run the whole program.
        Instead, it uses the data that is stored in temppow2 and allows
        alternative approaches to inference to be explored. This is
        particularly valuable when the required simulation time is lengthy.
<p>
    <b>ci(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specifies the width of the confidence interval for the
        corresponding power estimate (default 95%).
<p>
    <b>dist(</b><i>normal/t</i><b>)</b> specifies the distribution of effect sizes used to sample
        a value from in order to simulate a new study(ies).  The default for
        the (<i>random</i>) and (<i>randomi</i>) is a predictive distribution based on the
        t-distribution (<i>t</i>) allowing for heterogeneity between studies (and
        the uncertainty in the heterogeneity).  The default for all other
        models is the (<i>normal</i>) distribution based on the mean and variance
        entered in <b>es</b> and <b>var</b>.
<p>
    <b>ind</b> instructs the program to calculate the power for the newly simulated
        study on its own in addition to the newly updated meta-analysis.
<p>
    <b>nip(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> specifies the number of integration points used for
        quadrature when the bivariate model is selected. Higher values should
        result in greater accuracy but typically at the expense of longer
        execution times (see Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles 2005, app.
        B).
<p>
    <b>sos(</b><i>sens/spec</i><b>)</b> used in addition to the <i>inference</i> option this specifies
        whether inferences are focused on sensitivity or specificity when
        using <i>ciwidth</i> or <i>lci</i> as inference options. The default option is to
        use sensitivity. If <b>sos</b> is not specified then the inferences are
        based on both the sensitivity and specificity and two values should
        be entered for <b>pow</b>.
<p>
    <b>level</b> specifies the confidence level, as a percentage, for the individual
        study and pooled confidence intervals. This is the level that is
        given in the <b>metan</b>, <b>metandi</b> and <b>midas</b> commands when called on to
        meta-analyses the current data set. The default is level(95).
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>

    Fixed effect meta-analysis of clinical trials using the odds ratio,
    assuming 100 patients in both the control group and the treatment group
    of the new study and using a confidence interval width cut-off of 2 on
    the odds ratio scale to calculate power through 100 iterations (i.e.
    power is based on the proportion of the simulations in which the
    confidence interval for the pooled OR is less than 2).

    calculate power through 1000 iterations (i.e. power is based on the
    proportion of simulations in which the p-value for the treatment effect
    being different from 0 is less then 0.05).

    Unstandardised mean difference comparing exercise to no treatment in
    patients with chronic back pain (Ferreira et al. 2012). We investigate
    the power of the updated meta-analysis when comparing the lower
    confidence interval to a reduction in pain of 20 points. We choose a
    sample size of 250 patients in each arm. We then use <b>extfunnel</b> to
    intuitively explain the simulated individual studies on the extended
    funnel plot (Crowther et al. 2012).

    sensitivity and specificity to base inferences on, assuming 1000 patients
    in the diseased group and 250 patients in the healthy group of the new
    study and using 95% confidence interval widths of 0.2 and 0.1 for
