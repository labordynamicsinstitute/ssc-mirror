<b><u>Cook's D and DFBETAs after mixed models (beta version)</u></b>

<p>
    <b>mltcooksd</b> is part of the <b>mlt</b> (multilevel tools) package.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>mltcooksd</b> estimates Cook's D and DFBETAs for the second level units in
    two-level mixed models estimated with  xtmixed,  xtmelogit or  xtmepoisson
    (Stata Version 11 or above).  Cook's D describes the influence that the
    exclusion of a single level-two unit has on the estimated model parameters.
    DFBETAs describes the influence that a single level-two unit has on each of
    the independent variables in the model.
<p>
    By default <b>mltcooksd</b> reports Cook's D for the whole model (random+fixed
    part).  The options<b> fixed</b> and<b> random</b> add separate estimates of Cook's D for
    the random and the fixed part of the model. See Snijders and Berkhof (2008:
    158) for the formulas of Cook's D.
<p>
    For models with a random part, Cook's D and DFBETAs cannot be estimated
    from the matrices stored after the regression. The Ado <b>mltcooksd</b> goes the
    empirical way and calculates Cook's D and DFEBTAs by estimating a series of
    models, excluding each level-two unit one at a time. We follow Van der Meer
    et. al. (2006) in this approach.
<p>
    mltcooksd will show and use cutoff values for Cook's D and DFBETAs. These
    cutoff values are based on Belsley et. al. (1980: 13).  The cutoff value
    for Cook's D is 4/n, with n= number of level-two units.  The cutoff value
    for DFBETAs is 2/sqrt(n), with n = number of level-two units.
<p>
    <b>mltcooksd</b> stores each estimated model. The command <b>mltshowm</b> produces an
    estimation table for all models that produce a Cook's D value above the
    cutoff.  If you want to display other models estimated by <b>mltcooksd</b>, have a
    look at the list of stored models (estimates dir). All models stored by
    <b>mltcooksd</b> begin with the letters WJ, followed by the number of the left out
    level-two unit, e.g. WJ1 is the model estimated without (Unit) J=1.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>keepvar(</b><i>prefix</i><b>)</b> specifies whether <b>mltcooksd</b> should keep the variables
        containing Cook's D and DFBETAs values.  You have to specify a prefix
        which is used in the variable names.
<p>
    <b>counter</b> specifies that <b>mltcooksd</b> displays the estimated time until the
        program finishes. Depending on your model <b>mltcooksd</b> can run quite a
        long time, so it might be interesting to see how long it will run.  The
        first estimate will be given after estimating the first model. Then,
        <b>mltcooksd</b> gives a new refined estimate after each new estimation.
<p>
    <b>graph</b> specifies that <b>mltcooksd</b> produces a box plot showing the distribution
        of DFBETAs for each independent variable in the model.
<p>
    <b>slabel</b> suppresses the value labels of the level-two units in the graph (if
        specified) and in the listing of Cook's D and DFBETAs.
<p>
    <b>fixed</b> lists Cook's D for the fixed part of the model separately.
<p>
    <b>random</b> lists Cook's D for the random part of the model separately.
<p>
    <b>approx</b> computes an approximation of Cook's D and DFBETAs (following
        Snijders and Berkhof 2008, Snijders and Bosker 1999).  The
        approximation can be derived much faster than the complete computation.
        The option is for use after <b>xtmelogit</b> and <b>xtmepoisson</b>.  Details: We
        perform only one iteration for each model, starting from the
        coefficient vector of the full model (one-step estimator).  More
        iterations are only done if the model does not converge. We do not use
        the algorithms proposed in Snijders and Berkhof 2008 (IGLS, RIGLS,
        Fisher scoring), but the same algorithm that has been used to compute
        the full model (in most cases the default: Stata's modified
        Newton-Raphson).
