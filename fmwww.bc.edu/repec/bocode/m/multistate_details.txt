TITLE: `MULTISTATE' : module for multi-state survival analysis.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: multistate provides a set of commands for multi-state survival analysis. -msset- is a data 
preparation tool which converts a dataset from wide (one observation per subject, multiple time and status variables) to long 
(one observation for each transition of which a subject is at risk). -msaj- calculates the non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimates 
of transition probabilities. -msboxes- creates a descriptive plot of the multi-state process through the transition matrix and 
numbers at risk. -stms- fits joint transition-specific survival models, allowing each transition to have a different parametric 
model, yet maximised jointly to enable sharing of covariate effects across transitions. -predictms- calculates a variety of 
predictions from a multi-state survival model, including transition probabilities, length of stay (restricted mean time in each 
state), the probability of ever visiting each state and more. Predictions are made at user-specified covariate patterns. 
Differences and ratios of predictions across covariate patterns can also be calculated. Standardised (population-averaged) 
predictions can be obtained. Confidence intervals for all quantities are available. Simulation or the Aalen-Johansen estimator 
are used to calculate all quantities. User-defined predictions can also be calculated by providing a user-written 
Mata function, to provide complete flexibility. -predictms- can be used with a general transition matrix (cyclic or acyclic), and 
allows the use of transition-specific timescales.
