Description
- -----------
<p>
^omodel^ is an alternative to @ologit@ and @oprobit@ for estimating ordered
logit and probit models.  It produces the same results but it also reports an
approximate likelihood-ratio test of whether the coefficients are equal across
categories (i.e. a test of the proportional-odds assumption if logit is the
requested model).

Examples
- --------
<p>
        . use auto.dta, clear
        . ^omodel probit rep78 mpg weight^
        . ^ologit^                            /* to redisplay results */
<p>
        . tab foreign rep78
        . ^omodel logit rep78 foreign^                /* Put data into 2-way */
&gt;  
        . gen obs=1                                   /* table of counts to  */
&gt;  
        . collapse (count) obs, by(rep78 foreign)       /* demonstrate use of  
&gt; */
        . ^omodel logit rep78 foreign [fweight=obs]^  /* fweights            */

Methods and formulas
- --------------------
<p>
Let there be K outcomes of the dependent variable depvar and for convenience,
let's call the outcomes 1, 2, ..., K, although ^omodel^ places no constraint
on the labeling of the outcomes.
<p>
^omodel^ estimates the ordered logit or probit model using ^ologit^ or 
^oprobit^ as requested.
<p>
An approximate version of the model is also fitted by using all K-1 binary 
variables obtained from dichotomisations of the ordered scale. From this an 
approximation to the log-likelihood obtained from the ^ologit^ or ^oprobit^ 
model is obtained. In most cases the approximation will be very good.
<p>
In a similar fashion, an approximation to the log-likelihood for a completely
general model (in which there are different effects at each cut-point for 
every variable) is obtained. Note that this model cannot be fitted in Stata
by maximum-likelihood. The difference between the two approximate 
log-likelihoods is the likelihood-ratio test reported by ^omodel^. The 
approximation to the log-likelihood value for the general model will usually
be less reliable than the first approximation but both are underestimates of
the respective true log-likelihoods. Hence in taking the difference between
the two approximations we obtain a reasonable approximation to the true 
lieklihood-ratio test. 
<p>
The ratio is tested on degrees of freedom that are the difference between the
number of fitted parameters in the standard and general models. This will
typically be (p)*(K-2), where p is the number of regressors specified,
although under certain sparse data conditions there will be fewer degrees of
freedom (see the second example above).
<p>
Finally, and very importantly, note that a significant p-value is evidence to
reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients are equal across categories.
A non-significant p-value does not justify the conclusion that we have an 
appropiate model for the data. This mistake is often made in the 
implementation of this test.
