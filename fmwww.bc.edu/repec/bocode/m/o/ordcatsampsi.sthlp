{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt ordcatsampsi} computes sample size at a specified power, and power at a specified sample size, for a two sample comparison of ordinal outcomes under the proportional odds ordinal logistic model. The power is the same as that of the Wilcoxon test but with ties handled properly. {opt ordcatsampsi} uses the methods of Whitehead (1993) and produces identical results as those produced by the R package {browse "https://rdrr.io/cran/Hmisc/man/popower.html":popower}.



{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:or(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the expected odds ratio (treatment effect); {cmd:or() is required}.

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:alpha(}{it:#}{cmd:)} sets the significance level of the test. The default is {cmd:alpha(0.05)}.

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:power(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the desired power at which sample size is to be computed. 
{cmd:power()} cannot be specified together with {cmd:n()}, {cmd:n1()}, or {cmd:n2()}.

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:n(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the total number of subjects in the study to be used for determining power.
{cmd:n()} cannot be specified together with {cmd:power()}. 

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:n1(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the number of subjects in the control group to be used for determining power. 
{cmd:n1()} cannot be specified together with {cmd:power()}.

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:n2(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the number of subjects in the experimental group to be used for determining power.
{cmd:n2()} cannot be specified together with {cmd:power()}.

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:nratio(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies the sample-size ratio of the experimental group relative to the control group, 
{cmd:N2/N1}, for two-sample tests. The default is {cmd:nratio(1)}, meaning equal allocation between the two groups.

{p 4 8 2} 
{cmd:onesided(}{it:#}{cmd:)} indicates a one-sided test. The default is two sided. 



{title:Examples}

{pstd}
{opt 1) Computing sample size:}{p_end}

{pstd}Using the worked example in Campbell et al (1995), the 4 categories are "normal", "slightly listless", "moderately listless", and "very listless", and their respective 
proportions are 0.14, 0.24, 0.24, and 0.38. The expected odds ratio is 0.33, and we want an equal number of subjects in both groups with power set to 0.80 and alpha 0.05. {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. ordcatsampsi 0.14 0.24 0.24 0.38, or(.33) nratio(1) power(0.80) alpha(0.05)}{p_end}

{pstd}
{opt 2) Computing power:}{p_end}

{pstd}Same as above but we specify total n = 84 to find the power at that sample size. {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. ordcatsampsi 0.14 0.24 0.24 0.38, or(.33) n(84)}{p_end}
