<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    Changes to <b>outreg</b> since version 3.  
<p>
    This version is a complete rewrite of outreg, mostly programmed in Mata.
    All it shares with the previous versions of outreg other than the name is
    part of the command syntax.
<p>
    The objective of this version was as complete control of the layout and
    formatting of estimation tables as possible, creating both Word and TeX
    files.
<p>
    1. The most obvious change to outreg is that it now writes fully
        formatted Word or TeX files rather than flat text files.  For this
        reason, there are a lot of new options relating to fonts, text
        justification, cell border lines, etc. that were not needed before.
<p>
    2. <b>outreg</b> can now display any number of statistics for each estimated
        coefficient (instead of just two), and these statistics can be
        displayed side-by-side as well as one above the other.  One can
        choose from 26 different statistics for inclusion in a table,
        including the full panoply of marginal effects and confidence
        intervals.
<p>
    3. One can now selectively keep or drop coefficients or equations from
        the estimation results.
<p>
    4. Tables can be merged or appended more flexibly than before.  Multiple
        tables can also be written successively to the same file with regular
        paragraphs of text in between, so that it is possible to create a
        whole statistical appendix in a single document with a .do file.
<p>
    5. Text can include italic, bold, super and subscripts, and Greek
        characters.  It is possible to include user-specified fonts (
        addfont).  Column titles can span multiple cells (multicol).
        Footnotes can be added to any part of the table (annotate).
<p>
    6. The table created by <b>outreg</b> is displayed in the Stata results window,
        minus some of the finer formatting destined for the Word or TeX file.
<p>
<p>
    Some <b>outreg</b> syntax changes may cause confusion:
<p>
    1. Name of "append" option changed.
        Successive estimation results are now combined with the merge option,
        which was named the "append" option in previous versions of <b>outreg</b>.
        This makes the new <b>outreg</b> consistent with the way the Stata <b>merge</b>
        command works on datasets versus the Stata <b>append</b> command.
<p>
    2. By default, variable labels are not used.
        In the new <b>outreg</b>, variable labels replace variable names only when
        the varlabels option is chosen.
<p>
    2. By default, multiequation models are not merged into multiple columns.
        Estimated coefficients from multiequation models like reg3 and mlogit
        are reported in one (long) column by default.  To merge them into
