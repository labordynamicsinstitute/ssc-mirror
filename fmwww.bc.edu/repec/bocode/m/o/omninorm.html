<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>omninorm</b> performs an omnibus test for normality on one or several
    variables proposed by Doornik and Hansen (1994, 2008), itself based on a
    test by Shenton and Bowman (1977). The test statistic is based on
    transformations of skewness and kurtosis that are much closer to standard
    normal than the raw moment measures. The test may be applied to a set of
    variables, such as the residuals from a multivariate regression. Doornik
    and Hansen conducted simulations that illustrate that this test will
    generally have better size and power than several proposed in the
    literature, including the multivariate Shapiro-Wilk test of Royston
    (1983). They find that their omnibus test "is simple, has correct size
    and good power properties" (Doornik and Hansen 2008, p.936).
<p>
    Under the null hypothesis of normality of the specified k variables, the
    test statistic is distributed chi-squared with 2 k degrees of freedom. An
    asymptotic form of the test is also provided, which is essentially a
    multivariate equivalent of the Bowman and Shenton (1975) test, which
    those authors consider "unsuitable, except in very large samples"
    (Doornik and Hansen 2008, p.928).

<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>allobs</b> specifies use of the maximum possible number of observations for
        each variable. The default is to use only those observations for
        which all variables in <i>varlist</i> are not missing.  This option bites
        only if <b>marginals</b> is also specified.
<p>
    <b>by()</b> specifies a variable defining distinct groups for which statistics
        should be calculated. <b>by()</b> is allowed only with a single <i>byvar</i>. The
        choice between <b>by:</b> and <b>by()</b> is partly one of precisely what kind of
        output display is required. The display with <b>by:</b> is clearly
        structured by groups while that with <b>by()</b> is more compact. To show
        statistics for the marginal distributions of several variables and
        several groups with a single call to <b>omninorm</b>, the display with <b>by:</b>
        is essential.
<p>
    <b>marginals</b> specifies that whenever several variables are specified,
        univariate (i.e. marginal) tests are to be carried out for each.
<p>
    <b>missing</b> specifies that with the <b>by()</b> option observations with missing
        values of <i>byvar</i> should be included in calculations. The default is to
        exclude them.
