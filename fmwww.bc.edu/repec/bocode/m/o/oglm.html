<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>oglm</b> estimates Ordinal Generalized Linear Models. When these models
    include equations for heteroskedasticity they are also known as
    heterogeneous choice/ location-scale / heteroskedastic ordinal regression
    models.  <b>oglm</b> supports multiple link functions, including logit (the
    default), probit, complementary log-log, log-log and cauchit.
<p>
    When an ordinal regression model incorrectly assumes that error variances
    are the same for all cases, the standard errors are wrong and (unlike OLS
    regression) the parameter estimates are biased.  Heterogeneous choice/
    location-scale models explicitly specify the determinants of
    heteroskedasticity in an attempt to correct for it.  Further, these
    models can be used when the variance/variability of underlying attitudes
    is itself of substantive interest.  Alvarez and Brehm (1995), for
    example, argued that individuals whose core values are in conflict will
    have a harder time making a decision about abortion and will hence have
    greater variability/error variances in their responses.
<p>
    Several special cases of ordinal generalized linear models can also be
    estimated by <b>oglm</b>, including the parallel lines models of <b>ologit</b> and
    <b>oprobit</b> (where error variances are assumed to be homoskedastic), the
    heteroskedastic probit model of <b>hetprob</b> (where the dependent variable
    must be a dichotomy and the only link allowed is probit), the binomial
    generalized linear models of <b>logit</b>, <b>probit</b> and <b>cloglog</b> (which also assume
    homoskedasticity), as well as similar models that are not otherwise
    estimated by Stata.  This makes <b>oglm</b> particularly useful for testing
    whether constraints on a model (e.g. homoskedastic errors) are justified,
    or for determining whether one link function is more appropriate for the
    data than are others.
<p>
    Other features of <b>oglm</b> include support for linear constraints, making it
    possible, for example, to impose and test the constraint that the effects
    of x1 and x2 are equal.  <b>oglm</b> works with several prefix commands,
    including <b>by</b>, <b>nestreg</b>, <b>xi</b>, <b>svy</b> and <b>sw</b>.  Its <b>predict</b> command includes the
    ability to compute estimated probabilities.  The actual values taken on
    by the dependent variable are irrelevant except that larger values are
    assumed to correspond to "higher" outcomes. Up to 20 outcomes are
    allowed. <b>oglm</b> was inspired by the SPSS PLUM routine but differs somewhat
    in its terminology, labeling of links, and the variables that are allowed
    when modeling heteroskedasticity.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>link(</b><i>logit/probit/cloglog/loglog/cauchit/log</i><b>)</b> specifies the link function
        to be used.  The legal values are <b>link(</b><i>logit</i><b>)</b>, <b>link(</b><i>probit</i><b>)</b>,
        <b>link(</b><i>cloglog</i><b>)</b>, <b>link(</b><i>loglog</i><b>)</b> and <b>link(</b><i>cauchit</i><b>)</b> which can be
        abbreviated as <b>link(</b><i>l</i><b>)</b>, <b>link(</b><i>p</i><b>)</b>, <b>link(</b><i>c</i><b>)</b>, <b>link(</b><i>ll</i><b>)</b> and <b>link(</b><i>ca</i><b>)</b>.
        <b>link(</b><i>logit</i><b>)</b> is the default if the option is omitted.
<p>
        NOTE: <b>link(</b><i>log</i><b>)</b> is also available but is considered experimental (and
        possibly wrong) at this point. Stata’s <b>glm</b> program successfully uses
        the log link with dichotomous dependent variables but it is not clear
        how and how well it generalizes to the ordinal case.
<p>
        The following advice is adapted from Norusis (2005, p. 84):  Probit
        and logit models are reasonable choices when the changes in the
        cumulative probabilities are gradual. If there are abrupt changes,
        other link functions should be used. The log-log link may be a good
        model when the cumulative probabilities increase from 0 fairly slowly
        and then rapidly approach 1. If the opposite is true, namely that the
        cumulative probability for lower scores is high and the approach to 1
        is slow, the complementary log-log link may describe the data.
<p>
        WARNING: Programs differ in the names used for some links.  Stata's
        loglog link corresponds to SPSS PLUM's cloglog link; and Stata's
        cloglog link is called nloglog in SPSS.
<p>
    <b>hetero(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b>, <b>scale(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b> and <b>eq2(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b> are synonyms (use only
        one of them) and can be used to specify the variables believed to
        affect heteroskedasticity in heterogeneous choice/ location-scale
        models.  In such models the model chi-square statistic is a test of
        whether the choice/location parameters and the
        heteroskedasticity/scale parameters differ from zero; this differs
        from <b>hetprob</b>, where the model chi-square only tests the
        choice/location parameters. The more neutral-sounding <b>eq2(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b>
        alternative is provided because it may be less confusing when using
        the <b>flip</b> option.
<p>
        WARNING: The default Wald tests conducted by the <b>nestreg</b> and <b>sw</b>
        prefix commands can give incorrect results when the same variable
        appears in both the location and scale equations.  In such cases it
        is recommended that you use <b>nestreg</b>'s and <b>sw</b>'s likelihood ratio test
        options.
<p>
    <b>flip</b> causes the command-line placement of the location and scale
        variables to be reversed, i.e. what would normally be the location
        variables will instead be the scale variables, and vice- versa.  This
        is primarily useful if you want to use the <b>sw</b> or <b>nestreg</b> prefix
        commands to do stepwise selection or hierarchical entry of the
        heteroskedasticity/scale variables. (Just be sure to keep straight
        which set of variables is which!) Again, if you do this, remember to
        use the likelihood ratio test options of <b>nestreg</b> or <b>sw</b>, because the
        default Wald tests may be wrong otherwise.
<p>
    <b>hc</b> and <b>ls</b> affect how the equations are labeled.  If <b>hc</b> is used, then,
        consistent with the literature on heterogeneous choice, the equations
        are labeled "choice" and "variance". If <b>ls</b> is used, the equations are
        labeled "location" and "scale", which is consistent with SPSS PLUM
        and other published literature.  If neither option is specified, then
        the scale/heteroskedasticity equation is labeled "lnsigma", which is
        consistent with other Stata programs such as <b>hetprob</b>.
<p>
    <b>force</b> can be used to force <b>oglm</b> to issue only warning messages in some
        situations when it would normally give a fatal error.  By default,
        the dependent variable can have a maximum of 20 categories.  A
        variable with more categories than that is probably a mistaken entry
        by the user, e.g. a continuous variable has been specified rather
        than an ordinal one.  But, if your dependent variable really is
        ordinal with more than 20 categories, <b>force</b> will let <b>oglm</b> analyze it
        (although other practical limitations, such as small sample sizes
        within categories, may keep it from coming up with a final solution.)
        Obviously, you should only use <b>force</b> when you are confident that you
        are not making a mistake. <b>trustme</b> can be used as a synonym for <b>force</b>.
<p>
    <b>lrforce</b> forces Stata to report a Likelihood Ratio Statistic under certain
        conditions when it ordinarily would not.  Some types of constraints
        can make a Likelihood Ratio chi-square test invalid. Hence, to be
        safe, Stata reports a Wald statistic whenever constraints are used.
        But, for many common sorts of constraints (e.g. constraining the
        effects of two variables to be equal) an LR chi- square statistic is
        probably appropriate. Note that the <b>lrforce</b> option will be ignored
        when robust standard errors are specified either directly or
        indirectly, e.g. via use of the <b>robust</b> or <b>svy</b> options. Use this
        option with caution.
<p>
    <b>store(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> causes the command <b>estimates store </b><i>name</i> to be executed when
        <b>oglm</b> finishes.  This is useful for when you wish to estimate a series
        of models and want to save the results. See help estimates.
<p>
        WARNING: The <b>store</b> option may not work correctly when the <b>svy</b> prefix
        is used.
<p>
    <b>log</b> displays the iteration log. By default it is suppressed.
<p>
    <b>or</b> reports the estimated coefficients transformed to relative odds
        ratios, i.e., exp(b) rather than b; see <b>[R] ologit</b> for a description
        of this concept.  Options <b>rrr</b>, <b>eform</b>, <b>irr</b> and <b>hr</b> produce identical
        results (labeled differently) and can also be used. It is up to the
        user to decide whether the exp(b) transformation makes sense given
        the link function used, e.g.  it probably doesn't make sense when
        using the probit link.
<p>
    <b>constraints(</b><i>clist</i><b>)</b> specifies the linear constraints to be applied during
        estimation.  The default is to perform unconstrained estimation.
        Constraints are defined with the constraint command. <b>constraints(1)</b>
        specifies that the model is to be constrained according to constraint
        1; <b>constraints(1-4)</b> specifies constraints 1 through 4;
        <b>constraints(1-4,8)</b> specifies 1 through 4 and 8.
<p>
    <b>robust</b> specifies that the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance is
        to be used in place of the traditional calculation.  <b>robust</b> combined
        with <b>cluster()</b> allows observations which are not independent within
        cluster (although they must be independent between clusters).  If you
        specify <b>pweight</b>s, <b>robust</b> is implied.
<p>
    <b>cluster(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies that the observations are independent across
        groups (clusters) but not necessarily within groups. <i>varname</i>
        specifies to which group each observation belongs; e.g.,
        <b>cluster(personid)</b> in data with repeated observations on individuals.
        <b>cluster()</b> affects the estimated standard errors and
        variance-covariance matrix of the estimators (VCE), but not the
        estimated coefficients. <b>cluster()</b> can be used with <b>pweight</b>s to
        produce estimates for unstratified cluster-sampled data.
<p>
    <b>level(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the confidence level in percent for the confidence
        intervals of the coefficients; see help level.
<p>
    <i>maximize_options</i> control the maximization process; see help maximize.
        You should never have to specify most of these.  However, the
        <b>difficult</b> option can sometimes be useful with models that are running
        very slowly or not converging at all.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options for predict</u></b>
<p>
    <b>pr</b>, the default, calculates the predicted probabilities.  If you do not
        also specify the <b>outcome()</b> option, you must specify k new variables,
        where k is the number of categories of the dependent variable.  Say
        that you fitted a model by typing <b>oglm result x1 x2</b>, and <b>result</b> takes
        on three values.  Then you could type <b>predict p1 p2 p3</b> to obtain all
        three predicted probabilities.  If you specify the <b>outcome()</b> option,
        you must specify one new variable.  Say that <b>result</b> takes on the
        values 1, 2, and 3.  Typing <b>predict p1, outcome(1)</b> would produce the
        same <b>p1</b>.
<p>
    <b>xb</b> calculates the linear prediction.  You specify one new variable, for
        example, <b>predict linear, xb</b>.  The linear prediction is defined,
        ignoring the contribution of the estimated cutpoints.
<p>
    <b>sigma</b> calculates the standard deviation, also known as the scale.  You
        specify one new variable, for example, <b>predict sigma, s</b>.  If the
        model does not include an equation for heteroskedasticity then the
        predicted sigma value is missing for all cases.
<p>
    <b>stdp</b> calculates the standard error of the linear prediction.  You specify
        one new variable, for example, <b>predict se, stdp</b>.
<p>
    <b>outcome(</b><i>outcome</i><b>)</b> specifies for which outcome the predicted probabilities
        are to be calculated.  <b>outcome()</b> should contain either a single value
        of the dependent variable or one of <b>#1</b>, <b>#2</b>, <i>...</i>, with <b>#1</b> meaning the
        first category of the dependent variable, <b>#2</b> the second category,
        etc.
<p>
    <b>scores</b> calculates equation-level score variables.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <i>Example 1. Basic models.</i>  By default, <b>oglm</b> will estimate the same models
    as <b>ologit</b>.  The <b>store</b> option is convenient for saving results if you want
    to contrast different models.

        <b>. predict p1 p2 p3 p4</b>
<p>
    <i>Example 4.  Constrained logistic regression.</i>  <b>logit</b>, <b>ologit</b>, <b>probit</b> and
    <b>oprobit</b> provide other and generally faster means for estimating
    non-heteroskedastic models with logit and probit links; but none of these
    commands currently supports the use of linear constraints, such as two
    variables having equal effects.  <b>oglm</b> can be used for this purpose.  For
    example,
<p>
        <b>. use http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/stata/spex_data/ordwarm2.dta,</b>
            <b>clear</b>
        <b>. recode warm (1 2 = 0)(3 4 = 1), gen(agree)</b>
        <b>. * Constrain the effects of male and white to be equal</b>
        <b>. constraint 1 male = white</b>
        <b>. oglm agree yr89 male white age ed prst, lrf store(constrained) c(1)</b>
        <b>. oglm agree yr89 male white age ed prst, store(unconstrained)</b>
        <b>. lrtest constrained unconstrained</b>
<p>
<p>
    <i>Example 5.  Other link functions.</i>  By default, <b>oglm</b> uses the logit link.
    If you prefer, however, you can specify probit, complementary log log,
    log log or log links.  In the following example, the same model is
    estimated using each of the links supported by oglm (note that <b>link(</b><i>log</i><b>)</b>
    is considered experimental and possibly wrong.}
<p>
        <b>. use http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/stata/spex_data/ordwarm2.dta,</b>

        <b>. oglm warm yr89 male white age ed prst, link(ca)</b>
        <b>. oglm warm yr89 male white age ed prst, link(log)</b>
<p>
<p>
    <i>Example 6.  Prefix commands.</i>  <b>oglm</b> supports many of Stata 9's prefix
    commands. For example,
<p>
        <b>. use http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/stata/spex_data/ordwarm2.dta,</b>
            <b>clear</b>
        <b>. sw, pe(.05): oglm warm yr89 male</b>
        <b>. xi: oglm warm yr89 i.male</b>
        <b>. nestreg: oglm warm (yr89 male white age) (ed prst)</b>
<p>
    <i>Example 7.  heteroskedasticity/scale/eq2 option.</i>  The <b>het</b>, <b>scale</b> and <b>eq2</b>
    options are synonyms, use whichever one you prefer.  <b>ls</b> and <b>hc</b> are
    optional and affect whether the equations are labeled consistently with
    the heterogeneous choice or location-scale literature. If also using the
    <b>sw</b> or <b>nestreg</b> prefix commands, you should use their likelihood ratio test
    options since the default Wald tests can be wrong when the same variable
    appears in both the location and scale equations. Note that it is
    possible to estimate a heteroskedasticity-only model, and that the
    variables in the two equations do not need to be the same.
<p>
        <b>. use http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/stata/spex_data/ordwarm2.dta,</b>

            <b>male white)</b>
        <b>. nestreg, lr: oglm warm yr89 male white age ed prst, het(yr89 male</b>
            <b>white)</b>
<p>
<p>
    <i>Example 8.  The flip option.</i>  In the last two examples, we did stepwise
    selection and hierarchical entry of the choice/location variables.
    Suppose we wanted to do stepwise selection or hierarchical entry of the
    heteroskedasticity/scale variables instead?  We can use the <b>flip</b> option,
    which causes the command-line placement of the location and scale
    variables to be reversed.  Just make sure you specify each variable list
    correctly - while the <b>hetero</b>, <b>scale</b> and <b>eq2</b> options are all synonyms, you
    may find it less confusing if you use <b>eq2</b> with <b>flip</b>.  Also remember to
    use the likelihood ratio test options with <b>nestreg</b> or <b>sw</b>. In the
    following examples, because of the <b>flip</b> option, the choice variables are
    yr89, male, white, age, ed, and prst, while the hetero variables are
    yr89, male, and white.

     <b>gologit2</b> is a related program and may be more appropriate than <b>oglm</b> for
     some purposes.  The two programs can also be used together if you wish to
     contrast heterogeneous choice / location-scale models with gologit models.
