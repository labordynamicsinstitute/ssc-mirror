{pstd}
{cmd:opendf_csv2zip} Transforms survey data from several csv files into dta-format including metadata saved in labels and characteristics. {p_end}
{pstd}The file containing the data has to be named data.csv {p_end}
{pstd}The file containing the metadata for the datset has to be named dataset.csv {p_end}
{pstd}The file containing the metadata for the variables has to be named variables.csv {p_end}
{pstd}The file containing the metadata for the values has to be named categories.csv {p_end}

{pstd}{opt output} Name of the output-zip-folder. Can also include a path where to save the output. {p_end}
{pstd}{opt input} is a path to a folder where 4 csvs have to be included that contain data and metadata. {p_end}
{pstd}If you are exporting the entire dataset, you can choose whether or not to export all available metadata (labels and descriptions of the dataset and the variables). {p_end}
{pstd}By default all metadata is exported ({opt variables_arg("yes")}): information describing the dataset itself, as well as information describing all variables in the dataset. {p_end}
{pstd}If you set {opt variables_arg("no")}, only the information describing the dataset is exported. {p_end}
{pstd}Option {opt export_data} indicates whether the data.csv should be exported to the opendf-zip file. Default is {opt export_data("yes")}. To save a dataset in opendf-format "yes" is necessary. Otherwise only the xml with the metadata is created. {p_end}
