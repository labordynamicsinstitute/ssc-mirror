        <b>ofrtplot7</b> [<i>varname</i>] [ <b>,</b> <b>super</b> <b>tfrac(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <i>graph_options</i> <b><u>nla</u></b><b>bel(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>ofrtplot7</b> plots observed, fitted and residuals from the last model against a
covariate. It is designed for time series models and by default the covariate
is whatever has been <b>tsset</b> as the time variable. However, other variables may
be specified, whether or not data have been <b>tsset</b>.
<p>
Observed values are for the response or dependent variable from the last model,
fitted values are whatever <b>predict</b> produces by default and residuals are
whatever <b>predict, res</b> produces. The plot is restricted to the estimation
sample.
<p>
By default, the plot has two panels. In the top panel, observed and fitted are
plotted against the covariate. In the bottom panel, residuals are plotted
against the covariate, by default as spikes from zero.
<p>
This is the original version of <b>ofrtplot</b> for Stata 7, renamed <b>ofrtplot7</b>. Users
of Stata 8 upwards should upgrade to <b>ofrtplot</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
Whenever
<p>
    the time variable has a <b>%t</b> or <b>%d</b> format, and
<p>
    neither <b>xlabel</b> nor <b>xlabel()</b> is specified, and
<p>
    values span more than one year
<p>
<b>ofrtplot7</b> attempts to select for the time (<i>x</i>) axis nice labels based on the
years included in the time series.  For daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or
half-yearly data, it attempts to show the first time period within each of
various years which are nice numbers. For yearly data, it attempts to show
years which are nice numbers. Nice numbers here are preferably multiples of 10,
5 or 2. The main algorithm used is based on code by Hardin (1995).
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>super</b> specifies that plots are to be superimposed, not separate.
<p>
<b>tfrac(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the fraction of the graph image taken up by the top panel.
    The default is 0.625. If the fraction specified is 1, the bottom panel is
    suppressed, while if it is 0, the top panel is suppressed.
<p>
<i>graph_options</i> are options of <b>graph, twoway</b>, except for <b>by()</b> and <b>rescale</b>. The
    defaults include <b>gap(5)</b> and (if <i>varname</i> is specified) <b>sort</b>.
<p>
    If <b>symbol()</b> is specified, the first two symbol specifications refer to
    observed and fitted and the second two symbol specifications refer to
    residuals and zeros.  The default is <b>sy(iiii)</b>.
<p>
    If <b>connect()</b> is specified, the first two connect specifications refer to
    observed and fitted and the second two connect specifications refer to
    residuals and zeros.  The default is <b>c(ll[-]||)</b>.
<p>
    By default, with no <b>super</b> option, the plot shows two separate panels, and
    <b>rlabel</b>, <b>rlabel()</b>, <b>rline</b>, <b>rline()</b>, <b>rtick</b>, <b>rtick()</b>, <b>rscale()</b>, <b>r1title()</b> and
    <b>r2title()</b> refer to the corresponding y axis options of the bottom panel.
    That is, <b>rlabel</b> is the <b>ylabel</b> option for the y or residual axis, <b>r1title()</b>
    is the <b>l1title()</b> option for that axis, and so forth. Thus these options may
    be thought of as specifying options referring to the <b>r</b>esidual axis.
<p>
    Correspondingly, <b>ylabel</b>, <b>ylabel()</b>, <b>yline</b>, <b>yline()</b>, <b>ytick</b>, <b>ytick()</b>,
    <b>yscale()</b>, <b>l1title()</b> and <b>l2title()</b> refer to the y axis options of the top
    panel.
<p>
    With the <b>super</b> option, only one panel is produced, and these options all
    have their usual meanings.
<p>
    Note, however, that <b>saving()</b> and <b>title()</b> refer to the combined graph image,
    whatever other options are specified.
<p>
<b>nlabel(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> suggests the number of nice labels to be shown on the time axis. The
    suggestion may or may not be taken literally. This option is independent of
    <b>xlabel</b> or <b>xlabel()</b>.
<p>
