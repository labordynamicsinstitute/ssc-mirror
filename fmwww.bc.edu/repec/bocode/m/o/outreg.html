  ^outreg^ is available after any estimation command.  A textlist 
         (my own term) is a list of text separated by commas, i.e. 
         "text" [, "text" ...].  It is similar to a numlist or a varlist, 
         but commas are required.  Each text element in the list does not need 
         to be enclosed in quotation marks unless the text contains commas.  
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^outreg^ formats regression output as it is presented in most documents.  The 
ultimate purpose of most estimation is to present the results in tables quite 
different from those displayed within Stata.  ^outreg^ automates the process of
&gt;  
converting the regression results to most of the standard presentation formats 
by creating a text file for inclusion in a word processing table.
<p>
^outreg^ should work after any estimation command in Stata (see [R] estimation 
commands for a complete list). Like @predict@, ^outreg^ makes use of internally
&gt;  
saved estimation results, so it should be invoked immediately after the 
estimation. In addition to coefficient estimates, by default ^outreg^ will 
report t statistics with asterisks for standard significance levels 
(1% and 5%), number of observations, true R-squareds (no pseudo R-squareds), 
and the number of groups in panel estimation.  The user can add their own 
chosen titles (^title^ and ^ctitle^), statistics (^addstat^), and notes 
(^addnote^) to the table, and change many aspects of the output.  The t 
statistics under the coefficients can be replaced by standard errors, p values 
of t statistics, confidence intervals, or normalized beta coefficients.
<p>
^outreg^ creates an ASCII text file with columns separated with tab 
characters.  The file can be converted automatically to a table in word 
processors and spreadsheets.  For example, the process in Microsoft Word is 
simple: Open or Insert the file created by ^outreg^.  Select the estimation 
output text that is in columns (not the notes at the bottom of the table or 
the title at the top, if any), and choose Table, Convert Text to Table.  With 
some adjustment of the column widths, fonts, etc. the final table is ready.  
In Excel, open the file created by ^outreg^ and follow the default choices in 
the Text Import Wizard (note that when loading the output into a spreadsheet, 
the parentheses around the t statistics may convert to negative numbers).  
Other word processors and speadsheet software should be similar.
<p>
Successive estimation results, possibly with different variables, can be 
combined by ^outreg^ in a single table with the variable coefficients lined up 
properly using the ^append^ option.  Multivariate regression commands like 
@sureg@, @mvreg@, and @reg3@ are formatted equation by equation, and can be 
appended.  
<p>
^outreg^ rewards the use of variable @label@s (and value labels for @mlogit@, 
@svymlog@, and @net:describe dlogit2, from (http://www.stata.com/users/wsribney
&gt; )!dmlogit2@). The variable labels are used in the output 
table (unless ^nolabel^ is chosen), providing more intelligible variable 
descriptions than 8-letter names. Note that if different variables are assigned
&gt;  
the same variable label (not usually done intentionally), and more than one 
regression is appended together, the coefficients and t statistics will not be 
properly ordered.  The solution is to use distinct variable labels or the 
^nolabel^ option. 
<p>
If filename is specified without an extension, .out is assumed.
<p>
If a varlist is specified, only the regression coefficients corresponding to 
the variables in varlist will be included in the table. The dependent variable 
name should not be included in the varlist since it has no regression 
coefficient.  With an explicit varlist the intercept coefficient will still be 
included unless the ^nocons^ option is chosen.  An explicit varlist is useful, 
for example, for excluding numerous dummy variable coefficients.
<p>
Many Stata estimation commands make it possible to exponentiate the 
coefficients under the procedure-specific names of odds ratios, hazard ratios, 
relative risk ratios, etc.  Since Stata leaves behind no evidence of whether 
the user has chosen to exponentiate the coefficients displayed by the original 
estimation, the user must respecify this choice in ^outreg^ with the ^eform^ 
option.  This is required even after the @stcox@ command which by default 
reports coefficients in hazard ratio form.  
<p>
A growing number of Stata commands, most of them STB additions, report the 
marginal effects of changes in the independent variables.  For most of these 
commands (@dprobit@, @net:describe dlogit2, from (http://www.stata.com/users/ws
&gt; ribney)!dlogit2@, @net:describe dlogit2, from (http://www.stata.com/users/wsr
&gt; ibney)!dprobit2@, 
and @net:describe dlogit2, from (http://www.stata.com/users/wsribney)!dmlogit2@
&gt; ) ^outreg^ will automatically report the marginal effects.  The commands 
@search:truncreg!truncreg,marginal@ and @search:dtobit!dtobit@ report both regr
&gt; ession coefficients and marginal effects, 
though, so the user must specify the ^margin^ option for ^outreg^ to report 
the marginal effects.

Options
-------
1. Text-related options
2. Coefficient options
3. Options for t statistics, standard errors, etc.
4. Other statistics options
5. Other options
<p>
<p>
1. Text-related options
-----------------------
<p>
^nolabel^ specifies that variable names rather than variable labels be used 
    to identify coefficients.  It also suppresses the value labels of the 
    dependent variable in @mlogit@, @svymlog@, and @net:describe dlogit2, from 
&gt; (http://www.stata.com/users/wsribney)!dmlogit2@.
    
^title(^textlist^)^ specifies a title or titles at the top of the regression 
    table.  The maximum title length is 80 characters.  Additional characters 
    will be cut off.  Longer titles can be put in two or more title lines.  
    When regression results are appended together, the table title(s) must be 
    specified in the first ^outreg^ call; titles specified in subsequent 
    ^outreg ... append^ calls will be ignored.  Note that when converting the 
    ^outreg^ text output to a table in a word processor or a spreadsheet, it 
    is easier to leave out the title row out of the text selected for 
    conversion.
<p>
^ctitle(^textlist^)^ specifies the regression title above the coefficient 
    column.  By default if no column title is specified, the label or name of 
    the dependent variable is displayed.  Multiple column titles are only 
    appropriate for multi-equation regressions, using one title per equation, 
    and then only if not ^onecol^.
<p>
^nonotes^ specifies that notes explaining the t statistics (or standard errors,
&gt;  
    etc.) and asterisks not be included.
    
^addnote(^textlist^)^ specifies user-added notes to be
    displayed in new lines at the bottom of the ^outreg^ table.  When 
    regression results are appended together, ^addnote^ must be specified 
    in the first ^outreg^ call; ^addnote^s specified in subsequent 
    ^outreg ... append^ calls will be ignored.  ^addnote^ is consistent with 
    ^nonotes^.  A blank line can be inserted by including "" as a note (see 
    example below).
<p>
<p>
Technical Note:  Text which includes quotation marks within the text (by means 
    of double quotation as in `"This is "quoted" text"') in ^title^, ^ctitle^, 
    and ^addnote^ displays correctly in single regression tables, but does not 
    display correctly when subsequent regressions are ^append^ed.
<p>
<p>
2. Coefficient options
----------------------
<p>
^bdec(^numlist^)^ specifies the number of decimal places reported for 
    coefficient estimates (the b's).  It also specifies the decimal places 
    reported for standard errors or confidence intervals if ^se^ or ^ci^ is 
    chosen.  The default value for ^bdec^ is 3. The minimum value is 0 and 
    the maximum value is 11.  If one number is specified in the numlist, it 
    will apply to all coefficients.  If multiple numbers are specified in the 
    numlist, the first number will determine the decimals reported for the
    first coefficient, the second number, the decimals for the second 
    coefficient, etc.  If there are fewer numbers in the numlist than
    coefficients, the last number in the numlist will apply to all the 
    remaining coefficients.
    
^bfmt(^textlist^)^ specifies the format type for coefficient estimates (and 
    standard errors or confidence intervals, if ^se^ or ^ci^ is chosen).  
    Possible format types are 
         e        - scientific notation; e.g. 1.00e+3
         f or fc  - fixed format (with commas for thousands with fc)
         g or gc  - general format (with commas for thousands with gc)
    The default type for ^bfmt^ is fc.  If multiple format types are 
    specified, they are applied to the coefficients the way that multiple 
    ^bdec^ parameters are applied.  This option is mainly to allow scientific 
    notation (e).  For an explanation of Stata numeric formats, see [U] 15.5.1 
    Numeric formats. 
    
^nocons^ specifies that the intercept (constant) coefficient estimate not be 
    reported.  This is not needed when the preceeding estimation has no 
    intercept coefficient.
<p>
^coefastr^ specifies that asterisks for significance levels are appended to 
    regression coefficients rather than to t statistics or standard errors.
    
^eform^ specifies that the exponentiated form of the coefficients be reported.
    This corresponds to the ^or^ option for @logit@, @clogit@, and @glogit@ 
    estimation, ^irr^ for @poisson@ estimation, ^rrr^ for @mlogit@, ^hr^ for 
    @cox@ and @stcox@ hazard models, and ^eform^ for @xtgee@, but it can be 
    used to exponentiate the coefficients after any estimation.  Exponentiation
    of coefficients is explained in ^[R] maximize - methods and formulas^.
    
    Note that the default form of @stcox@ output displayed by Stata is the 
    hazard rate form, so to save the same numbers in outreg use the 
    ^eform^ option.  
<p>
^margin[(u|c|p)]^ specifies that the marginal effects rather than the coefficie
&gt; nt 
    estimates are reported.  It can be used after @search:truncreg!truncreg,mar
&gt; ginal@ 
    from STB 52 or @search:dtobit!dtobit@ from STB 56.  One of the parameters u
&gt; , c, or p 
    is required after @search:dtobit!dtobit@, corresponding to the unconditiona
&gt; l, 
    conditional, and probability marginal effects, respectively.  It is not 
    necessary to specify ^margin^ after @dprobit@, @net:describe dlogit2, from 
&gt; (http://www.stata.com/users/wsribney)!dlogit2@, @net:describe dlogit2, from (
&gt; http://www.stata.com/users/wsribney)!dprobit2@, 
    and @net:describe dlogit2, from (http://www.stata.com/users/wsribney)!dmlog
&gt; it2@.
<p>
<p>
3. Options for t statistics, standard errors, etc.
--------------------------------------------------
<p>
^se^ specifies that standard errors rather than t statistics are reported. The 
    decimal places displayed are those set by ^bdec^.
<p>
^pvalue^ specifies that p values (of t statistics) rather than t statistics
    are reported.  The decimal places displayed are set by ^tdec^.
<p>
^ci^ specifies that confidence intervals of coefficients rather than 
    t statistics are reported.  The decimal places displayed are those set by 
    ^bdec^.
    
^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence 
    intervals.  The default is level(95) or as set by @set level@; see [U] 23.5
&gt;  
    Specifying the width of confidence intervals. ^level^ does not affect the 
    confidence levels of asterisks.
<p>
^beta^ asks that normalized beta coefficients be reported rather than 
    t statistics (see the beta option of @regress@).  The decimal places 
    displayed are those set by ^bdec^.
    
^tdec(^#^)^ specifies the number of decimal places reported for t statistics 
    or for p values if ^pvalue^ is specified. It also specifies the decimal 
    places reported for R-squared or adjusted R-squared if they are not 
    specified in ^rdec^.  The default value for ^tdec^ is usually 2, but 3 
    if ^pvalue^ is specified. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value 
    is 11.
    
^noparen^ specifies that no parentheses be placed around t statistics,
    standard errors, etc.
    
^bracket^ specifies that square brackets [] be used rather than parentheses ()
    around t statistics, standard errors, etc.    
    
^noaster^ specifies that no asterisks denoting 1% and 5% significance levels
    be reported.
    
^3aster^ specifies 3 asterisks for 1%, 2 asterisks for 5%, and 1 asterisk for 
    10% significance levels.
<p>
^10pct^ specifies a "+" for 10 significance levels in addition to the default
    2 asterisks for 1%, 1 asterisk for 5% significance levels (unless sigsymb
    is specified - see below).
<p>
^sigsymb(^textlist^)^ specifies symbols for 1% and 5% significance levels 
    (and 10% significance level if ^10pct^ is also chosen).  The specified 
    symbols replace the asterisks ** and *. Quotation marks around the new 
    symbols are optional if the characters "," and are avoided.  Here are 
    two examples:
      . outreg using table1, sigsymb(++,+)
      . outreg using table1, sigsymb( (1%), (5%), (10%)) 10pct
    Omitting symbols will prevent the significance level from being labeled 
    (see also ^noaster^).  The following example will display only 1% 
    significance levels:
      . outreg using table1, sigsymb(*)
<p>
<p>
4. Statistics options
---------------------
<p>
^nonobs^ specifies that the number of observations in the estimation not be 
    reported.
 
^noni^ specifies that the number of groups in a panel data regression not be 
    reported (e.g. the number of groups specified by the i() variable in 
    @xtreg@).  This option has an effect only after @xt@ regression commands.
 
^nor2^ specifies that no R-squared (or adjusted R-squared) be reported.  This 
    option has an effect only if Stata calculates a true R-squared.
<p>
^adjr2^ specifies that the adjusted R-squared be reported rather than the 
    regular R-squared (in regressions where the adjusted R-squared is 
    defined).
<p>
^rdec(^#^)^ specifies the number of decimal places reported for the R-squared
    or adjusted R-squared.  The default value for ^rdec^ is the value for 
    ^tdec^. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 11.
    
^addstat("^text^" , ^# [^, "^text^", ^# ...] ^)^ specifies user-added 
    statistics to be displayed in new lines below the R-squared (if shown).  
    The user must specify both a name and a value for the statistic.  Users 
    can report significance levels of test statistics as a second statistic 
    to be shown on the line below the first statistic (see example below).
    
^adec(^numlist^)^ specifies the number of decimal places reported for 
    user-added statistics (in ^addstat^).  The default value for ^rdec^ is 
    the value for ^tdec^. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 11.
    If one number is specified in the numlist, it will apply to all 
    statistics.  If multiple numbers are specified in the numlist,
    they are applied to the user-added statistics as in ^bdec^.
<p>
^onecol^ specifies that multiequation models (e.g. @mlogit@, @reg3@, @heckman@)
&gt;  be 
    formatted in one column rather than the default of multiple columns, 
    one column per equation.  Extra statistics included in the e(b) vector are 
    also reported.  A varlist is not allowed when the ^onecol^ option is chosen
&gt; .
 
^xstats^ specifies that the extra statistics included in the e(b) matrix be
    reported.  Extra statistics for multi-equation models (i.e. @heckman@, 
    @heckprob@, and @biprobit@) are not reported - use ^addstat^ or ^onecol^.
    If there are no extra statistics in the e(b) matrix, ^xstats^ is ignored.
    This option is largely superceded by ^addstat^.
<p>
    
5. Other options
----------------
<p>
^comma^ specifies that the ASCII file output be separated by commas rather than
&gt;  
    by tabs.  This can cause problems if any of the user-defined text has 
    commas in it (such as variable labels, ^title^, ^ctitle^, ^addstat^, 
    or ^addnote^).  If that is the case, consider using ^quote^ as well.
    
^replace^ specifies that it is okay to replace filename if it already exists.
<p>
^append^ specifies that new estimation output be appended to an existing 
    output file.  In general, the same ^outreg^ options should be used in the 
    original regression output and each appended regression.  The notes at the 
    bottom of the table explaining the t statistics or standard errors and 
    asterisks are correct for the first estimation in the output file.  If 
    subsequently appended estimation results use different options (such as a 
    switch to ^noaster^, or change the estimation's ^robust^ option), the 
    notes will not be appropriate for all the columns.  This problem can be 
    addressed with a combination of ^nonotes^ and ^addnote^.

&gt; 768
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; ---
<p>
The simplest form of ^outreg^ just requires an output file name, in this case 
"auto1".  
<p>
    . ^outreg using auto1^
<p>
Usually one would load the output file auto1.out into a word processor 
as a table.  We can see the results of ^outreg^ within Stata using the @type@ 
command.  ^outreg^ output files ordinarily look jumbled when displayed using
@type@ so to improve the readability of these examples we have added spaces to 
make the columns line up properly.
<p>
    .^ type auto1.out^
                      Mileage (mpg)
    Car type            -1.650
                        (1.53)
    Weight (lbs.)       -0.007
                       (10.34)**
    Constant            41.680

    Observations          74
    R-squared            0.66
    Absolute value of t statistics in parentheses
    * significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%
<p>
Note that ^outreg^ uses the variable labels in place of variable names so that 
the independent variable mpg listed above the column of regression coefficients
&gt;  
uses the label "Mileage (mpg)", the variable foreign uses its label "Car type",
&gt;  
etc.  The user can change the variable labels before invoking ^outreg^ to 
provide the desired captions for the ^outreg^ results table.
<p>
<p>
Decimal places of coefficients; column titles
------------------------------------------------
<p>
By default the regression coefficients are shown with three decimal places, but
&gt;  
this isn't very satisfactory for the weight variable in the regression above.  
The weight coefficient is statistically significant, but only one non-zero 
digit is displayed.  We could use the option ^bdec(5)^ to display 5 decimal 
places for all the coefficients, but we can do better.  To display five decimal
&gt;  
places of the weight coefficient only and two decimal places of the other 
coefficients, we use ^bdec(2,5,2)^.  We also add a column title "Base case (mpg
&gt; )" 
to distinguish this regression from a second regression we will append to the 
table in the next example below.  Quotation marks are not required around the 
column title because it the text does not contain commas.
<p>
    . ^outreg using auto2, bdec(2,5,2) ctitle(Base case (mpg))^
    . ^type auto2.out^
                    Base case (mpg)
    Car type            -1.65
                        (1.53)

    R-squared            0.66
    Absolute value of t-statistics in parentheses
    * significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%
<p>
<p>
Appending two regression tables together; number formats for coefficients
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
Researchers presenting their results commonly combine several related 
estimations in the same table.  ^outreg^ combines results with the ^append^ 
option.  First we add a quadratic term for the weight variable in a new
regression.
<p>
    . ^gen weightsq = weight^^2^
    . ^label var weightsq "Weight squared"^
    . ^regress mpg foreign weight weightsq^

The weightsq coefficient is so small that it is difficult to display without 
scientific notation (as displayed in the @regress@ output).  By default, 
^outreg^ displays coefficients in fixed format.  We can change the weightsq 
coefficient numeric format to scientific (while keeping the rest fixed) with 
the ^bfmt(f,f,e,f)^ option.  To specify the decimal places for the 
coefficients, we could use the option ^bdec(2,5,2,2)^, but the last 2 is 
unnecessary because the last decimal place value applies to all the rest of the
&gt;  
coefficients.  We now ^append^ the results of the new regression to the 
previous regression results.

Technical Note: Originally I created an example where the "Base case" 
regression was ^regress mpg weight foreign^ and the "Quadratic" regression was 
^regress mpg weight weightsq foreign^.  The ^outreg^ table ordered the 
coefficients: 
     weight    foreign     weightsq
because all the regressors in the first estimation are listed before any new 
regressors in the appended estimation.  Most people would prefer to list the 
weightsq coefficient immediately after the weight coefficient since they are
related.  There are three ways to get this result.  The first is shown in the
example above: make weight the last regressor in the first estimation and
weightsq the first new regressor in the second estimation.  The second way
is to keep the order of the regressors unchanged in the estimation but include 
a varlist in the first ^outreg^ to reorder the coefficients:
    . ^outreg foreign weight using auto2, bdec(2,5,2) title(base case (mpg))^
The third way and the only way to obtain the coefficient ordering
    weight     weightsq    foreign
in the ^outreg^ table (given that weightsq is not include in the first 
estimation) is to reorder the rows by hand after the table is created by 
^outreg^.

Typical format for economics journals: standard errors, brackets, and no asteri
&gt; sks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; ---
<p>
Economics journals often prefer standard errors to t statistics 
and don't use asterisks to denote statistical significance.  The ^se^ option 
replaces t statistics with standard errors, the ^bracket^ option replaces 
parentheses with brackets, and the ^noaster^ option suppresses asterisks.  The 
^title^ option adds a title at the top of the ^outreg^ table.  The title requir
&gt; es 
quotation marks because it contains a comma.  Note that the decimal places 
specified by the ^bdec^ option apply to both the coefficients and the standard 
errors.

Using a varlist, no constant, and adding an explanatory note
------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
Specifying a varlist in ^outreg^ can be convenient to limit the output table 
to only the essential coefficients.  For example, we may want to control for
the influence of dummy variables, but not report their estimated coefficients. 
&gt;  
As an example, we create categorical dummy variables for the five repair scores
&gt;  
in the auto.dta dataset and add them to our simple regression above. 
<p>
    . ^tab rep78, gen(repair)^
      (output omitted)
<p>
    . ^regress mpg foreign weight repair1-repair4^
      (output omitted)
<p>
If the only coefficients of interest are those of foreign and weight, they can 
be specified in the varlist.  The constant in the regression will still be 
reported in the ^outreg^ table unless suppressed with the ^nocons^ option.  The
&gt;  
constant coefficient is not very meaningful in this case when dummy variables 
are included in the regression but their coefficients are not reported, so we 
suppress it.  We also add a note to the bottom of the table explaining that 
the dummy variable coefficients are not shown, using the ^addnote^ option.
Note that since the text in ^addnote^ does not contain parentheses or commas
it does not need quotation marks.  The ^outreg^ command is too long for one
line, so it uses the Stata comment symbols (/* ... */) to comment out the end 
of the line and continue the command syntax on the next line.

Added statistics and notes
--------------------------
<p>
^outreg^ allows for a number of statistics besides coefficients to be included 
in output tables (number of observations, R-squared, etc.).  Users may 
nevertheless want to add a range of additional statistics to their estimation 
tables at different times, so the ^addstat^ option allows the inclusion of 
arbitrary user-specified statistics below the estimated coefficients (and below
&gt;  
number of observations and R-squared, if reported).  Say we wanted to test the
equality of two of the estimated coefficients and report the results in the tab
&gt; le.
After a simple regression, the @test@ command will report an F statistic and 
the associated p value in the macros r(F) and r(p).
<p>
    . regress mpg foreign weight length
     (output omitted)
<p>
    . test foreign length
     (output omitted)
<p>
^addstat^ can report include multiple statistics, each one of which is 
displayed on a separate line.  The arguments for each statistic are a text 
string (the name of the statistic) and number (the statistic value).  To 
report just the F statistic the ^addstat^ option might be 
^addstat(F test: Car type=Length=0, r(F))^.  Below we include the p value of 
the F statistic as a second statistic.  The ^adec^ option specifies the 
reported decimal places for each statistic.  
<p>
The ^outreg^ command below also includes another example of the ^addnote^ 
option, first inserting a blank line after the rest of the table output with
an empty string (""), followed by the time the program was run (from the 
built-in Stata functions $S_TIME and $S_DATE), and the dataset used by the 
estimation (from the Stata function $S_FN).

<p>
<p>
Stata return value macros r(), e(), or s() can be included directly in the 
^addstat^ option in place of statistic values as shown above.  Another example
would be to report a pseudo R-squared after a logit estimation, which ^outreg^ 
does not otherwise report.  The addstat option could be 
^addstat(Pseudo R-squared, e(r2_p))^.  To see all the statistics available in 
memory after an estimation command, type @estimates list@ or ^est li^, and afte
&gt; r 
an r-class command (notably most tests and @summarize@), type @return list@ or 
^ret li^.  
<p>
In some cases it is better to save the value of a previously calculated 
statistic in a local macro and then put the macro value into ^addstat^.  This
would be the case, for example, if after a regression two test commands were 
run which return r() values, both of which are to be reported with the
regression results in ^outreg^.  The second test command would wipe out the 
r() values from the first test command.  Say both test commands (called
test1 and test2) created F statistics, then the user could save the first F 
statistic in a local macro:
<p>
    . ^regress y x1 x2^
    . ^test1 x1^
    . ^local F1 = r(F)^
    . ^test2 x2^
    . ^outreg using 2test, addstat(Test1 F, `F1', Test2 F, r(F))^
<p>
<p>
Multiequation models and column titles
--------------------------------------
<p>
The creation of output tables for multiequation models is straightforward with 
^outreg^.  Each equation has its own column in the table.  To label the 
equation column headings with something other than the dependent variable 
labels, the user chooses the ^ctitle^ option with multiple text strings, as 
many strings as equations.  The example below uses the @reg3@ three-stage 
least squares estimation of the Klein macro model (see [R] reg3).
<p>

If the user prefers an ^outreg^ table with all the equations' coefficients in 
a single column after a multiequation estimation, the ^onecol^ option provides 
this.
<p>
<p>
Exponential transformations of coefficients
-------------------------------------------
<p>
As noted above, there is no way of knowing after an estimation command if the 
user chose to report the exponentiated form of coefficients.  The user must 
choose the ^eform^ option in ^outreg^ to get the same form of the coefficients.
<p>
For duration models, the exponential form is known as the hazard ratio.  For 
other models it is known as odds ratio, relative risk ratio, or incidence rate 
ratio. 
<p>
The example here uses the panel Cox regression shown in [R] @stcox@.

Marginal Effects
----------------
<p>
A number of Stata commands (mostly STB additions) report the estimated marginal
&gt;  
effects of coefficients.  Most of the commands only report marginal effects, 
and the user need not do anything special when invoking ^outreg^.  Two recent 
STB commands, @search:truncreg!truncreg,marginal@ and @search:dtobit!dtobit@, t
&gt; hough, report 
both the coeffients and the marginal effects, so the user must tell ^outreg^ 
whether to report the marginal effects with the ^margin^ option.  After 
@search:truncreg!truncreg,marginal@, the user specifies the ^margin^ option wit
&gt; hout
arguments in outreg.  @search:dtobit!dtobit@, on the other hand, calculates thr
&gt; ee 
different marginal effects.  The user must specify which marginal effect ^outre
&gt; g^ 
will report using the ^margin^ option with the argument u, c, or p for the 
unconditional, conditional, or the probability uncensored, respectively.
<p>
We use Stata's auto dataset again to estimate a @tobit@ model and calculate the
&gt;  
marginal effects with @search:dtobit!dtobit@.

<p>
 Although the user can only choose a single kind of marginal effect to include
 in each ^outreg^ command after the @search:dtobit!dtobit@ command, the user co
&gt; uld 
 use ^outreg^ several times with different marginal effects and append the 
 results together into a single table.
