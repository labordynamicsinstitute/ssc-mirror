{marker remarks}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}This command from the opendf package is part of the Open Data Format Project bundle, written to assist with survey data files in the open data format(.zip).{p_end}
{pstd}Due to cross-plattform compability of the Open Data Format some Stata-specific features are not supported by the ODF.{p_end}
{pstd}There are no value label names in the ODF. Therefore, value label names are lost when a datset is written to ODF. Value labels reveice generic names when an ODF file is read in Stata.{p_end}
{pstd}Extended missings for numeric variables (.a, .b, ..., .z) are not available in ODF specification. Therefore, extended missings are converted to ordinary missings (.) {p_end}
{pstd}Value Labels of extended missings er not written to ODF file.{p_end}
