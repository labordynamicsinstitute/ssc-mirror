<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>metaan</b> command performs a meta-analysis on a set of studies and
    calculates the overall effect and a confidence interval for the effect.
    The command also displays various heterogeneity measures: Cochrane's Q,
    I-squared (0-100% with larger scores indicating heterogenity) , H-squared
    (zero in the case of homogeneity) and the between-study variance
    estimate. Cochrane's Q is the same across all methods, but the
    between-study variance estimate (and hence I-squared and H-squared) can
    vary between the <b>dl</b> and <b>ml</b> methods. Only one method option must be
    selected. For calculating the effects and variance of the effects, for a
    group of studies, from various statistical parameters please see metaeff.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
        +-------+
    ----+ Model +------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>fe</b> Fixed-model that assumes there is no heterogeneity between the
        studies. The model assumes that within-study variances may differ,
        but that there is homogeneity of effect size across allstudies.
        Often the homogeneity assumption is unlikely and variation in the
        true effect across studies is to be expected.  Therefore, caution is
        required when using this model. Reported heterogeneity measures are
        estimated using the <b>dl</b> model.
<p>
    <b>dl</b> DerSimonian-Laird, the most commonly used random-effects model. Models
        heterogeneity between the studies i.e. assumes that the true effect
        can be different for each study. The method assumes that the
        individual study true effects are distributed with a variance tau^2,
        around an "overall" true effect, but makes no assumptions about the
        form of the distribution of either the within- or between-study
        effects.  Reported heterogeneity measures are estimated using the <b>dl</b>
        model.
<p>
    <b>ml</b> Maximum likelihood random-effects model. Makes the additional
        assumption (necessary to derive the log-likelihood function, and also
        true for <b>reml</b> and <b>pl</b> below) that both the within-study and
        between-study effects have Normal distributions. It solves the
        log-likelihood function iteratively to produce an estimate of the
        between-study variance. However, the method does not always converge
        while in some cases the between-study variance estimate is negative
        and set to zero (in which case the model is reduced to the <b>fe</b> model).
        Estimates are reported as missing in the event of non-convergence.
        Reported heterogeneity measures are estimated using the <b>ml</b> model.
<p>
    <b>reml</b> Restricted maximum-likelihood random-effects model. Similar method
        to <b>ml</b> and using the same assumptions. The log-likelihood function is
        maximized iteratively to provide estimates as in <b>ml</b>. However, under
        <b>reml</b> only the part of the likelihood function which is location
        invariant is maximized (i.e. maximizing the portion of the likelihood
        that does not involve mu, if estimating tau^2, and vice versa).  The
        method does not always converge while in some cases the between-study
        variance estimate is negative and set to zero (in which case the
        model is reduced to the <b>fe</b> model). Estimates are reported as missing
        in the event of non-convergence. Reported heterogeneity measures are
        estimated using the <b>reml</b> model.
<p>
    <b>pl</b> Profile likelihood random-effects model. Profile likelihood uses the
        same likelihood function as <b>ml</b>, but takes into account the
        uncertainty associated with the between-study variance estimate when
        calculating an overall effect, by using nested iterations to converge
        to an maximum. The confidence intervals provided by the method are
        asymmetric and hence so is the the diamond in the forest plot.
        However, the method does not always converge. Values that were not
        computed are reported as missing. Reported heterogeneity measures are
        estimated using the <b>ml</b> model (the effect and tau^2 estimates are the
        same, only the confidence interevals are re-estimated) but also
        provides a confidence interval for the between-study variance
        estimate.
<p>
    <b>pe</b> Permutations random-effects model. A non-parametric random-effects
        method, which can be described in three steps. First, in line with a
        Null hypothesis that all true study effects are zero and observed
        effects are due to random variation, a dataset of all possible
        combinations of observed study outcomes is created by permuting the
        sign of each observed effect. Then the <b>dl</b> method is used to compute
        an overall effect for each combination. Finally, the resulting
        distribution of overall effect sizes is used to derive a confidence
        interval for the observed overall effect.  The confidence interval
        provided by the method is asymmetric and hence so is the diamond in
        the forest plot. Reported heterogeneity measures are estimated using
        the <b>dl</b> model.
<p>
        +----------------------+
    ----+ Variable information +---------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>varc</b> Informs the program that the study effect variation variable
        (<i>varname2</i>) holds variance values. If this option is omitted the
        program assumes the variable contains standard error values (the
        default)
<p>
    <b>label(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> Selects labels for the studies.  Up to two variables can
        be selected and converted to strings. If two variables are selected
        they will be separated by a comma. Usually, the author names and the
        year of study are selected as labels. The final string is truncated
        to 20 characters.
<p>
        +-------+
    ----+ Graph +------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    Only one graph output is allowed in each execution
<p>
    <b>forest</b> Requests a forest plot. The weights from the specified analysis
        are used for plotting symbol sizes ({opth pe} uses {opth dl}
        weights).
<p>
    <b>forestw(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> Requests a forest plot with adjusted weight ratios for better
        display. The value can be in the [1,50] range.  For example if the
        largest to smallest weight ratio is 60 and the graph looks awkward
        the user can use this command to improve the appearance, by
        requesting the weight to be rescaled to a largest/smallest weight
        ratio of 30. It should be noted that only the weight squares in the
        plot are affected and not the model. The confidence intervals in the
        plot are unaffected.
<p>
    <b>plplot(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> Requests a plot of the likelihood function for the mu or
        tau^2 estimates of the <b>ml</b>, <b>pl</b> or <b>reml</b> models.  Option <b>plplot(</b><i>mu</i><b>)</b>
        fixes mu to its model estimate, in the likelihood function, and
        creates a two way plot of tau^2 vs the likelihood function.  Option
        <b>plplot(</b><i>tsq</i><b>)</b> fixes tau^2 to its model estimate, in the likelihood
        function, and creates a two way plot of mu vs the likelihood
        function.
