<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>mail</b> uses the OS's underlying sendmail program to send you emails.  It is
    meant to be used from withing programs running for a long time and send
    emails to either an email-to-sms gateway of your sms provider or to a
    mail push service so that you get progress reports on your cell phone or
    handheld in the form of sms or email.  It can append a number of lines
    from a given file typically the last lines from the file your program is
    logging into. For that you need to install<b> ashell</b> (ssc install ashell)
