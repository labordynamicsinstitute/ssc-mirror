Markov chain analysis

<p>
    ^markov^ varname [ , ^f^name^(^string^)^ ^p^name^(^string^)^
    tabchi_options ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^markov^ examines varname, treated as a sequence or series, to produce
basic summaries relevant to discrete-time, discrete-state Markov chains.
<p>
^markov^ tabulates one-step transition frequencies from one state to
another, carries out a chi-square test for independence, and tabulates a
transition probability matrix. The frequency matrix and the probability
matrix are saved as F and P, or as whatever names are specified.
Matrices with these names are overwritten.
<p>
It is the user's responsibility to ensure that data are in the
appropriate sort order when ^markov^ is called.
<p>
^tabchi^ must be installed first.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^fname(^string^)^ specifies a name for the frequency matrix (default F).
<p>
^pname(^string^)^ specifies a name for the probability matrix (default P).
<p>
tabchi_options are options allowed with ^tabchi^.
<p>
Example
