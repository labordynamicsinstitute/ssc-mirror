Sample size and power determination for multivariate regression
---------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
      ^mvsampsi^ # [^, a^lpha^(^#s^) p^ower^(^#s^) n(^#s^) ny(^#^) nx(^#^) nc(^
&gt; #^)^ ]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^mvsampsi^ estimates required sample size or power of tests for multivariate
F tests derived from Wilks' lambda.  If ^n()^ is specified, ^mvsampsi^ computes
&gt;  
power; otherwise, it computes sample size.  ^mvsampsi^ is an immediate command;
&gt;  
all of its arguments are numbers or ranges of numbers; see help @immed@.
<p>
At a given value of Wilks' lambda, ^mvsampsi^ computes power for each combina-
tion of alpha and n, or sample size for each combination of alpha and power.  
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
Options that accept a range of values understand single values, a comma and/or 
space delimited list of values, or entries of the form: #1 - #2 / #3.  The
latter specification acts as if you had entered every value between #1 and #2
at intervals of #3.  If #2 &gt; #1, #3 is added to #1, otherwise #3 is subtracted
from #1 (i.e., it takes the absolute value of #3).  Thus, specifying a range
of ".01 - .05 / .01" is equivalent to ".05 - .01 / .01."
<p>
^alpha(^#s^)^ specifies the significance level of the test; the default is 
    1-level/100 from ^set level^, see help @level@.  
<p>
^power(^#s^)^ is power of the test; the default is ^power(.90)^.
<p>
^n(^#s^)^ specifies the size(s) of the sample(s).  If specified, ^mvsampsi^
    reports the power calculation.  If not specified, ^mvsampsi^ computes
    sample size.
<p>
^ny(^#^)^ specifies the number of dependent variables.  Default is 1.
<p>
^nx(^#^)^ specifies the number of independent variables.  Count all but one
    category of any categorical variable as separate independent variables
    (e.g., a five category variable counts as four independent variables).
    Default is 1.
<p>
^nc(^#^)^ specifies the number of control variables; categorical variables
    treated as in ^nx()^.  Default is 0.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^mvsampsi^ follows Cohen's method of calculating power for multivariate
F tests based on Wilks' lambda (Cohen, 1988: 550-552).  A square root 
normal approximation of the noncentral F distribution is used to obtain
power values.  The noncentrality parameter is a function of effect size,
sample size, and numerator df; effect size depends on Wilks' lambda, and
the number of dependent and independent variables.  ^mvsampsi^ quietly
calls ^mvsamp1i^ to perform the calculations; see help @mvsamp1i@.

Examples
--------
<p>
Compute power with lambda = .75, ny = 8, nx = 6, nc = 0, n = 100, 
    alpha = .01 and .05:
<p>
 . ^mvsampsi .75, n(100) ny(8) nx(6) a(.01,.05)^
<p>
Compute power with lambda = .75, ny = 8, nx = 6, nc = 0, n = 100, 
    alpha = .01 to .05 at every .01:
<p>
 . ^mvsampsi .75, n(100) ny(8) nx(6) a(.01-.05/.01)^
<p>
Compute power with lambda = .75, ny = 8, nx = 6, nc = 0, n = 100 and 200:
<p>
 . ^mvsampsi .75, n(100 200) ny(8) nx(6)^
<p>
Compute sample size with lambda = .75, ny = 8, nx = 6, nc = 0, power = .8:
<p>
 . ^mvsampsi .75, ny(8) nx(6) p(.8)^
