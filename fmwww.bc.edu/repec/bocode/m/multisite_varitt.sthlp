{cmd:multisite_varITT} {hline 2} Estimates and conducts inference on the variance of ITTs across sites in multi-site randomized trials, 
and provides the ratio of the standard deviation of ITTs across sites to the average ITT, see Section 4.1 of de Chaisemartin & Deeb (2024). 
The command can also be used to estimate the variance of ITT effects across strata in stratified RCTs.

{p 4 8}
{it:What are the data requirements to use this command?}
{p_end}

{p 4 4} The command requires that the data be from a multi-site (stratified) randomized experiment, with at least two units assigned to treatment and control per site (stratum). As such, the command automatically drops any sites (strata) not satisfying this requirement.
{p_end}

{p 4 8}
{it:The results in the paper allow for weights w_s, what w_s does the command use?}
{p_end}

{p 4 4} The command automatically weights each site by its sample size: w_s=n_s/n
{p_end}

{p 4 8}
{it:What does [aweight] do then?}
{p_end}

{p 4 4}
[aweight] allows to use weights to estimate the ITT effects in each site, and the variance of those effects. [aweight] does not affect w_s.
