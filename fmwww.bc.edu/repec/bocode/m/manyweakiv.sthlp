{p2col :{hi:manyweakiv} {hline 2}}
implements the weak-identification robust jackknife AR test from Mikusheva and Sun (2022).  
The companying command {helpb manyweakivpretest} implements a new pre-test that is 
analogous to analogous to that of Stock and Yogo (2005) first stage F test,
 but robust to many instruments and heteroscedasticity.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
In empirical applications using instrumental variables, the current consensus 
practice is to report the first stage F statistic and as long as it is above 10, 
researchers are allowed to rely on standard t-statistics inferences. 
This practice has foundations in Stock and Yogo (2005) which showed that the 
concentration parameter fully characterizes the size distortion of the TSLS-Wald test, 
and empirically the concentration parameter can be judged based on the first stage F statistics. 
This result has been obtained under the assumptions of homoscedasticity and 
for a fixed number of instruments.

{pstd}
Mikusheva and Sun (2022) introduces a new F test that is valid under heteroscedasticity and many instruments.  Based on the result of this new F test (implemented in {opt manyweakivpretest}), applied researchers can switch between the 5% JIVE t-statistic or 5% jackknife AR test (implemented in {opt manyweakivtest}) with the caveats analogous to Stock and Yogo (2005):  Namely, the size of the two-step procedure are bounded within 15%.
