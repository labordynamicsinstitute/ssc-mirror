Maximum likelihood estimates of cointegration                   [STB-21: sts9]
---------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^mlcoint^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [^, noc^onstant ^l^ags^(^#^)^
                        ^non^ormal ^r^egress ^stand^ard ^s^tatic^(^varlist^)^ ]
<p>
        ^lrcotest^ varlist [^,^ ^c^ir^(^#^)^ ^r^estrict ]
<p>
        ^wcotest^ varlist [^,^ ^c^ir^(^#^)^ ]
<p>
^mlcoint^ calculates the eigenvalues and the maximal eigenvalue and trace 
statistics for the VAR defined by ^varlist^.  These statistics can be used 
to test for the number of cointegrating vectors in the system.  If the ^normal^
or ^standard^ option is specified, maximum likelihood estimates of the 
cointegrating vectors and of the matrix of weights are displayed.  ^mlcoint^ 
uses Johansen's method for computing the estimates and test statistics.  See 
the references for more information on the method.
<p>
^lrcotest^ and ^wcotest^ are used after ^mlcoint^ to test the null hypothesis
that one or more of the variables in the VAR do not enter the cointegrating
relationship(s).  ^lrcotest^ calculates the likelihood-ratio test.  ^wcotest^
calculates the Wald test.
<p>
Notes
-----
These programs rely on programs in the Stata time series library (STB-21: 
sts7.4).  The time series library must be available before ^mlcoint^ , ^lrcotes
&gt; t^,
or ^wcotest^ can be run.
<p>
^mlcoint^ creates several global matrices that are used by ^lrcotest^ and ^wcot
&gt; est^.
These matrices have names that begin with the characters "^M_^".

Options
-------
^c^ir^(^#^)^ indicates the number of cointegrating relationships in the system.
<p>
^noconstant^ suppresses the constant in the first stage VAR.
<p>
^l^ags^(^#^)^ specifies the number of lags in the original VAR (in levels).
<p>
^non^ormal suppresses the display of the normalized Alpha and Beta' matrices.
<p>
^r^egress indicates that the VAR estimates are to be displayed. 
<p>
^r^estrict requests that ^lrcotest^ display the restricted estimates of the
        eigenvalues and of the Alpha and Beta' matrices.
<p>
^stand^ard requests the display of the standardized Alpha and Beta' matrices
        instead of the normalized matrices.
<p>
^s^tatic^(^varlist^)^ specifies static variables that enter the VAR.
