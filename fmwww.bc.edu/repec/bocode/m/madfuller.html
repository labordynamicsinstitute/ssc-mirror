<b>madfuller</b> is for use with panel data.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before using
<b>madfuller</b>, using the panel form of <b>tsset</b>; see help tsset.
<p>
<i>varname</i> may contain time-series operators; see help varlist.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>madfuller</b> performs the multivariate augmented Dickey-Fuller (MADF) panel unit
root test (Sarno and Taylor, 1998; Taylor and Sarno, 1998) on a variable that
contains both cross-section and time-series components. The MADF test is a
generalization of the test developed by Abuaf and Jorion (1990) in which a
single autoregressive parameter is estimated over the panel. In contrast, Sarno
and Taylor allow for higher order serial correlation in the series and allow
the sum of autoregressive coefficients to vary across panel units under the
alternative hypothesis. The authors claim that the MADF test is "very much more
powerful than the univariate ADF test." (Taylor and Sarno, p. 298)
<p>
The test applies Zellner's seemingly unrelated equation estimator sureg
to <b>N</b> equations, defined for the <b>N</b> units of the panel. Each equation is
specified as a <b>k</b>-th order autoregression. The test involves testing the
hypothesis, for each equation, that the sum of the coefficients of the 
autoregressive polynomial is unity. The null hypothesis consists of the 
joint test that this condition is satisfied over the <b>N</b> equations. Under
the null hypothesis, all of the series under consideration are realizations
of I(1), or nonstationary, stochastic processes. The distribution of the 
test statistic must be approximated because of the "theoretically infinite
variance of the processes generating the ... series under the null
hypothesis." Taylor and Sarno (1998, p. 299) provide response surface 
estimates of the 5% critical values, derived from Monte Carlo simulation.
The response surface was estimated over sample sizes ranging from 25 to
500 observations per cross-sectional unit.

<p>
The test's null hypothesis should be carefully considered. It will be 
violated if even one of the series in the panel is stationary. A rejection 
should thus not be taken to indicate that each of the series is stationary. 
Johansen's likelihood ratio test (Sarno and Taylor, 1998) applies the opposite
hypothesis: that at least one of the series in the panel is a nonstationary 
process.
<p>
The test may be compared with Levin and Lin's (1993) panel unit root test 
levinlin which imposes a single autoregressive parameter over all units in the
panel but utilizes a variant of xtreg, fe for estimation. The Levin-Lin test
may thus be employed for small-T, large-N panels. However, the caveats
mentioned above apply to this test.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>lags</b>, which must be provided, specifies the lag orders to be used in augmenting
    the Dickey-Fuller regression. If multiple lag orders are given, the test is
    performed for each lag order.
