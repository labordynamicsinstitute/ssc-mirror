<b><u>List of specified days, say for axis labels or ticks</u></b>
<p>
        <b>mydays</b> [<i>if</i>] [<i>in</i>] <b>,</b> <b><u>l</u></b><b>ocal(</b><i>macname</i><b>)</b> [ <b><u>d</u></b><b>ays(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> <b>last</b>
                 <b><u>m</u></b><b>onths(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> <b><u>f</u></b><b>ormat(</b><i>date_format</i><b>)</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>mydays</b> displays a formatted list of specified days that lie within the
    range of a <b>tsset</b> daily date variable describing a time series and puts
    the numeric version of that list in a specified local macro. The result
    may be useful for specifying axis label or tick positions on graphs of
    time series.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    To use <b>mydays</b>, you must have a time series dataset defined by a daily
    date variable. If it has not been done previously, you must tsset. For
    example:
<p>
    <b>. sysuse sp500, clear</b>
    <b>. tsset date</b>
<p>
    If you ask for a time series graph, Stata by default uses its best guess
    at some "nice" dates as labelled dates on the time axis, in this case 1
    January 2001, 1 April 2001, 1 July 2001, 1 October 2001, 1 January 2002.
<p>
    <b>. tsline high low</b>
<p>
    Now suppose you do not like that default. In principle you just need to
    spell out which days you want, but that can be tedious. Differing month
    lengths and the existence of leap years mean that what you want is
    unlikely to be a regularly spaced series of days. <b>mydays</b> offers an
    alternative. Unless it is obvious otherwise, it takes the <b>tsset</b> time
    variable to be a daily date. Suppose you want the last days of each
    quarter:
<p>
    <b>. mydays, last months(3(3)12) local(last)</b>
    <b>. tsline high low, xla(`last', format(%dn_d))</b>
<p>
    The process thus entails two steps: define the days you want with <b>mydays</b>,
    and then feed the name of the macro containing them to the graph command,
    here <b>tsline</b>. In this case, <b>mydays</b> does not show 31 December 2000, as it
    is not within the range of the data, but that could be added on the fly:
<p>
    <b>. tsline high low, xla(`=mdy(12,31,2000)' `last', format(%dn_d))</b>
<p>
    For days other than the last of each month, you need to specify an
    argument for <b>days()</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>local(</b><i>macname</i><b>)</b> inserts the numeric list of daily dates in local macro
        <i>macname</i> within the calling program's space.  Hence that macro will be
        accessible after <b>mydays</b>, say for <b>graph</b> or other graphics commands.
        This option is required.
<p>
    <b>days()</b> specifies the days of each month you want to include. The argument
        must be a numlist of one or more integers between 1 and 31.
        Impossible dates implied by this and your choice of <b>months()</b> (e.g. 31
        February) will be ignored.
<p>
    <b>last</b> specifies that the last day of each month specified should be
        included in the macro. Leap year corrections are automatic. (Note to
        programmers: calculating in terms of <b>mdy(</b>#<b>,1,</b>#<b>) - 1</b> avoids ringing
        the changes on 28, 29, 30 and 31 days in each month and on ordinary
        and leap years.)
<p>
    At least one of <b>days()</b> and <b>last</b> must be specified.
<p>
    <b>months()</b> specifies the months you want to include. The argument must be a
        numlist of one or more integers between 1 and 12. The default is all
        months, i.e. <b>1/12</b>.
<p>
    <b>format()</b> specifies a format controlling the display of the list.  By
        default the format of the <b>tsset</b> time variable will be used.  This
        option has no effect on the contents of the macro and is intended
        only to help in checking that the list contains what is desired.
<p>

<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. sysuse sp500, clear</b>
    <b>. tsset date</b>
    <b>. mydays, day(1) local(ticks)</b>
    <b>. mydays, day(15) local(labels)</b>
    <b>. tsline high low, xla(`labels', labsize(*0.9) notick format(%dm))</b>
        <b>xtic(`=mdy(1,1,2001)' `ticks' `=mdy(1,1,2002)')</b>
