{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:mstfreq} Performs analysis of multisite randomised trials using a multilevel model under a frequentist setting.
This analysis produces {cmd:Effect Size} (ES) estimates for both conditional and unconditional model specifications. It also allows for sensitivity analysis options such as permutations
and bootstraps.


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Model}

{phang}
{opt ml} Calculates model using maximum likelihood estimation; default is Restricted Maximum Likelihood.

{phang}
{opt seed(#)} Sets seed number for permutations/bootstraps.

{phang}
{opt nperm(#)} Specifies number of permutations required to generate permutated p-values; see Stored results. 
If specified with {cmd:paste}, a list of generated variables attaches to the user's dataset containing the permutated effect sizes. 

{phang}
{opt nboot(#)} Specifies number of bootstraps required to generate the bootstrap confidence intervals.
If specified with {cmd:paste}, a list of generated variables attaches to the user's dataset containing the bootstrapped effect sizes.

{phang2}
{cmd:Note:} When running bootstraps or permutations, use {cmd:iterate()} to reduce the maximum number of log-likelihood iterations in order to induce quicker failure in the event of non-convergence; Stata default is {cmd:iterate(16000)}.
To identify non-convergence you can also specify the option {cmd:noisily}. Supplementary permutations/bootstraps are automatically deployed when # number of permutated/bootstrapped models have failed to converge. 

{phang}
{opt case(# [#])} Specifies case bootstrap with a specific resampling structure. The numlist may take the value(s) of integers 1 and/or 2 indicating which level should be resampled with replacement from.
If {cmd:case(1,2)} is selected, then resampling will first take place at school level (2) followed by resampling at the pupil level (1); default is {cmd:case(1)}. {p_end}

{phang}
{opt res:idual} Specifies type of bootstrap as the non-parametric residual bootstrap; default is case bootstrap. {p_end}

{phang}
{opt perc:entile} Specifies use of the percentile bootstrap confidence interval. {p_end}

{phang}
{opt basic} Specifies use of the basic (Hall's) bootstrap confidence interval; default is percentile. {p_end}

{phang}
{cmd:*} Additional maximization options are allowed including {cmd:technique()}, {cmd:difficult} see {helpb maximize:[R] Maximize}. {p_end}

{dlgtab:Reporting}

{phang}
{opt noisily} Displays the permutated/bootstrapped conditional models' regression results as they occur.
 
{phang}
{opt nodot} Suppresses display of dots indicating progress of permutations/bootstraps. Default is one dot character displayed for every block of 10 replications. {p_end}

{phang}
{opt paste} Attaches bootstrapped or permutated effect sizes to existing dataset if nperm (PermC/Unc_I#_W/T) or nboot (BootC/Unc_I#_W/T) has been specified, 
where I# denotes number of interventions, C/Unc denotes Conditional and Unconditional estimates and W/T within and total effect sizes. Existing variables generated from previous use are replaced. {p_end}
