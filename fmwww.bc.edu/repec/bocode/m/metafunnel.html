<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>metafunnel</b> plots funnel plots. These graphical displays are used to
    examine whether the results of a meta-analysis may have been affected by
    publication or other types of bias.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>by(</b><i>byvarname</i><b>)</b> displays subgroups according to the value of<i> byvarname</i>. The
        legend displays the value labels for the levels of<i> byvarname</i> if these
        are present; otherwise it displays the value of each level of
        <i>byvarname</i>.
<p>
    <b>eform</b> exponentiates the treatment effect theta and displays the
        horizontal axis (treatment effect) on a log scale. This is useful for
        displaying ratio measures such as odds ratios and risk ratios.
<p>
    <b>reverse</b> inverts the funnel plot so that larger studies are displayed at
        the bottom of the plot with smaller studies at the top.  This may
        also be achieved by specifying <b>noreverse</b> as part of the
        <b>yscale(</b><i>axis_description</i><b>)</b> graphics option.
<p>
    <b>noline</b> specifies that pseudo 95% confidence interval lines should not be
        included in the plot.  The default is to include them.
<p>
    <b>forcenull</b> forces the vertical line at the centre of the funnel to be
        plotted at the null treatment effect of zero (1 when the treatment
        effect is exponentiated). The default is for the line to be plotted
        at the value of the fixed effect summary estimate.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    Funnel plots are simple graphical displays of a measure of study size on
    the vertical axis against intervention or treatment effect on the
    horizontal axis. The name "funnel plot" is based on the fact that the
    precision in the estimation of the underlying intervention or treatment
    effect will increase as the size of component studies increases. Results
    from small studies will therefore scatter more widely, with the spread
    narrowing among larger studies. In the absence of bias the plot will
    resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel.
<p>
    If there is bias, for example because smaller studies showing no
    statistically significant effects remain unpublished, then such
    publication bias will lead to an asymmetrical appearance of the funnel
    plot. It should be noted that although funnel plots have traditionally
    been used to examine evidence for publication bias, funnel plot asymmetry
    may reflect other types of bias, or even result from the true
    intervention or treatment effect differing between small and large
    studies. They should thus be seen as displaying the evidence for "small
    study effects" in general rather than publication bias in particular.
    These issues are discussed by Egger<i> et al.</i> (1997) and Sterne <i>et al.</i>
    (2001a).
<p>
    <b>metafunnel</b> uses the same syntax as other meta-analysis commands such as 
    meta, metabias, metainf and metatrim.  The user provides an estimate of
    the treatment or intervention effect,<i> theta</i>, together with its associated
    standard error<i> se_theta</i> (the default) or variance<i> var_theta</i>, (in which
    case the<b> var</b> option should be specified). Alternatively, the user
    provides <i>exp(theta)</i> (i.e., a risk ratio or odds ratio) and its confidence
    interval,<i> (ll, ul)</i>).
<p>
    The funnel plots are displayed in line with meta-analytic convention and
    the recommendations of Sterne et al. (2001b). The effect of the treatment
    or intervention in each study (horizontal axis) is plotted against the
    study size, as measured by the standard error of the treatment or
    intervention effect.  (vertical axis). The vertical axis is reversed so
    that larger studies are displayed towards the top of the graph (this
    behaviour may be changed using the<b> reverse</b> option). Users who wish to
    plot the treatment effect on the vertical axis should use the <b>graph(begg)</b>
    option of the metabias command. The funnel command, which is part of the 
    metan package, also provides an alternative way to draw funnel plots.
<p>
    The plots include pseudo-95% confidence interval lines, which are drawn
    around the summary fixed-effect estimate of the intervention or treatment
    effect. The lines may be omitted using the <b>nolines</b> option.  The user may
    also specify that the pseudo confidence limits are centred around a zero
    intervention effect using the <b>forcenull</b> option.
<p>
    When the <b>eform</b> option is used, the label of the horizontal axis
    (treatment effect, <i>theta</i>) is changed accordingly, unless there is a
    variable label for<b> theta</b> or the<b> xtitle(</b><i>axis_title</i><b>)</b> graphics option is
    used.
<p>
    By default, the subtitle "Funnel plot with pseudo 95% confidence limits"
    is displayed. This may be changed using the graphics option
    <b>subtitle(</b><i>tinfo</i><b>)</b>.
