<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>medsens</b> is the workhorse function for conducting sensitivity analyses for
mediation effects. The analysis proceeds by quantifying the degree of
sequantial ignorability violation as the correlation between the error terms of
the mediator and outcome models, and then calculating the true values of the
average causal mediation effect for given values of this sensitivity parameter,
rho. The original findings are deemed sensitive if the true effects are found
to vary widely as function of rho. Sensitivity analysis for mediation is highly
recommended in the case of the single-experiment design where only the
treatment variable is randomized (or ignorable conditional on covariates).
Currently the medsens function handles three common cases. 1) both the outcome
and mediator are continuous, 2) the mediator is binary and the outcome is
continuous, and 3) the mediator is continuous and outcome binary.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b><u>med</u></b><b>iate(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is required and specifies the mediating variable to be used in
    the analysis.
<p>
<b>treat(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is also required and specifies the treatment variable used in
    the analysis.  Values of 0 and 1 are used.
<p>
<b>sims(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> specifies the number of simulations to run. The default value is
    100. For final production runs this should be set higher (~500) but note
    this will take longer.
<p>
<b>seed(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> sets the random number seed for precise replicability though with
    sufficient sims results will be very similar. The default value is the
    random seed Stata draws when starting a session.
<p>
<b>eps(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> convergence tolerance parameter for the iterative FGLS. Only used
    when both the mediator and outcome models are linear. The default value is
    .01. Typically users will not change this, and if so only will decrease it.
<p>
<b><u>gr</u></b><b>aph</b>, if specified, produces a graph of the results with the confidence
    intervals.
<p>
<b>Level(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> sets the confidence interval; default is <b>level(95)</b>.

<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
<b>medsens</b> only supports OLS and probit because sensitivity formula must be worked
out on a case by case basis.  Any estimation technique other than those will
produce an error. In the case of a binary mediator and continuous outcome, the
sensitivity analysis can take a long time especially with larger data sets. The
estimate of the ACME as a function of rho may also be plotted with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. An example is given above of plotting
delta(0).)
<p>
<b><u>Requires</u></b>
<p>
<b>medsens</b> requires the moremata package. In not already installed then enter "net
install moremata.pkg" into the command line.
<p>
<b><u>Saved results</u></b>
<p>
The program stores the rho (the correlation in error terms) at which the ACME=0
in the scalar:  r(errcr) . In addition, the product of R^2 for the mediator and
outcome model at which the ACME=0 is also stored.  This can be done using the
proportions of residual variance in the mediator and outcome explained by the
hypothesized unobserved confounder (r(r2s_thresh)) or the proportions of total
variance in the mediator and outcome explained by the hypothesized unobserved
confounder (r(r2t_thresh)).
<p>
The program also creates variables for the Average Causal Mediation Effect
(ACME) (_med_delta0 and _med_delta1) at each value of rho (_med_rho). For both
deltas, the low and high bounds of the 95% confidence interval are stored in
the lo and hi variables. Each time the command is run, the existing created
variables are dropped and new ones created.
