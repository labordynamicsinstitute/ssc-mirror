PROCEDURE MULTNORM NCOL NROW CORMAT MN* MULTNORM.SRC GENERATES A SAMPLE FROM A MULTIVARIATE* NORMAL POPULATION. THE USER SPECIFIES THE NUMBER* OF VARIABLES (NCOL), THE SAMPLE SIZE (NROW), AND* THE CORRELATION MATRIX (CORMAT). THE USER ALSO DESIGNATES* THE MATRIX (MN) WHERE THE SAMPLE IS TO BE STORED. BOTH* CORMAT AND MN SHOULD BE DECLARED IN THE PROGRAM THAT* CALLS MULTNORM.SRC; FOR EXAMPLE:*            DEC SYMM CORMAT(NCOL,NCOL)*            DEC RECT MN(NROW,NCOL)** SINCE CORMAT IS SYMMETRIC, ONLY THE ELEMENTS ON* AND BELOW THE MAIN DIAGONAL MUST BE SPECIFIED.* A CORRELATION MATRIX MUST BE POSITIVE DEFINITE.* BEFORE INVOKING MULTNORM.SRC, THE USER MAY WANT* TO VERIFY THAT CORMAT IS IN FACT POSITIVE DEFINITE BY* COMPUTING ITS EIGENVALUES WITH THE RATS INSTRUCTION* EIGEN.** THE ELEMENTS OF MN ARE STANDARD NORMAL VARIABLES. AFTER* MN HAS BEEN GENERATED, THE USER CAN EASILY CHANGE THE* MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS.TYPE INTEGER NROW NCOLTYPE RECT MNTYPE SYMM CORMATLOCAL VEC ALOCAL RECT CLOCAL INTEGER I J KLOCAL REAL SUMDIM A(NCOL) C(NCOL,NCOL)* FIND THE SQUARE ROOT OF CORMAT USING THE CHOLESKI* DECOMPOSITIONCOMPUTE C = %DECOMP(CORMAT)* PUT THE MULTINORMAL SAMPLE INTO ARRAY MNDO I = 1,NROWCOMPUTE A = %RAN(1.0)DO J = 1,NCOLCOMPUTE SUM = 0.0DO K = 1,NCOLCOMPUTE SUM = SUM + C(J,K)*A(K)END DO KCOMPUTE MN(I,J) = SUMEND DO JEND DO IEND
