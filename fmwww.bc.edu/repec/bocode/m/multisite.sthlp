{title:Description}

{p 4 8}
{cmd:multisite} wraps in four commands to estimate treatment-effect heterogeneity across sites in multi-site RCTs, and more generally in stratified RCTs. The four commands wrapped by {cmd:multisite} respectively estimate the variance of ITTs across sites, the variance of LATEs across sites, the regressions of ITTs on explanatory variables, and the sign of univariate regression coefficients from regressions of site-level LATEs on explanatory variables.

{p 4 8}One just needs to install {cmd:multisite} and execute it once to install those four commands.

{p 4 8}
{cmd:multisite_varITT} computes the estimated variance of ITTs across sites in multi-site randomized trials.

{p 4 8}
{cmd:multisite_varLATE} computes the estimated variance of LATEs across sites in multi-site randomized trials.

{p 12 12}

{p 4 8}
{cmd:multisite_regITT} computes the coefficients from a regression of site-level ITTs on site-level characteristics in multi-site randomized trials.
