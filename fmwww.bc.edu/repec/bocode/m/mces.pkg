d 'MCES': module for Marginal Comparison Effect Sizes
d
d  -mces- computes Hedgesâ€™s g for marginal comparisons produced
d by -margins- or -mimrgns- with the -pwcompare- option, including
d in complex samples. In order to facilitate effect size
d calculations with complex samples, -svysd- returns a pooled
d standard deviation sd* that is weighted by within-group sample
d size.
