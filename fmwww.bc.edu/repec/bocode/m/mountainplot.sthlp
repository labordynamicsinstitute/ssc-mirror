{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt mountainplot} produces mountainplots as proposed by Monti (1995). A mountainplot is a graphical representation of an empirical 
cumulative distribution function in which pecentile values above 50 are "folded" (i.e. subtracted from 100 in order to produce a 
reverse ordering). The resulting graphic resembles a mountain where the peak is approximately at the median.

{pstd}
Monti (1995) suggests that mountain plots allow the user to perform the following:{p_end}

{pstd}
1. Determine the median.{p_end}
{pstd}
2. Determine the range.{p_end}
{pstd}
3. Determine the central or tail percentiles of any magnitude.{p_end}
{pstd}
4. Observe outliers.{p_end}
{pstd}
5. Observe unusual gaps in the data.{p_end}
{pstd}
6. Examine the data for symmetry.{p_end}
{pstd}
7. Compare several distributions.{p_end}
{pstd}
8. Visually gauge the sample size.{p_end}



{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:standardize} transforms the data in {it:varlist} to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This option is 
particularly appropriate when more than one variable is being plotted and the variables are on different scales.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:{it:{help twoway_options:twoway_options}}} allows all available options for twoway graphs.



{title:Examples}

{pstd}Setup {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. use lungfunction.dta}{p_end}

{pstd} Produce a mountainplot for the first of four measurements of lung function in each of 20 schoolchildren (data are from Bland & Altman [1996])  {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1}{p_end}

{pstd} Now plot all four measurements of lung function  {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1 - rating4}{p_end}

{pstd}Same as above but used standardized values for the specified variables {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1 - rating4, stand}{p_end}
