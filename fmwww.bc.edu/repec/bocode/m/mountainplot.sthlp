{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt mountainplot} produces mountain plots for variables in a {it:varlist} as proposed by Monti (1995), and 
mountain plots for differences between variables in a {it:varlist} as proposed by Krouwer and Monti (1995). 
A mountainplot is a graphical representation of an empirical cumulative distribution function in which 
percentile values above 50 are "folded" (i.e. subtracted from 100 in order to produce a reverse ordering). The resulting 
graphic resembles a mountain where the peak is approximately at the median.

{pstd}
Monti (1995) suggests that mountain plots allow the user to perform the following:{p_end}

{pstd}
1. Determine the median.{p_end}
{pstd}
2. Determine the range.{p_end}
{pstd}
3. Determine the central or tail percentiles of any magnitude.{p_end}
{pstd}
4. Observe outliers.{p_end}
{pstd}
5. Observe unusual gaps in the data.{p_end}
{pstd}
6. Examine the data for symmetry.{p_end}
{pstd}
7. Compare several distributions.{p_end}
{pstd}
8. Visually gauge the sample size.{p_end}

{pstd}
Krouwer and Monti (1995) propose creating a mountain plot as a complementary to the Bland and Altman plot (Bland and Altman 1986). 
Here, the mountain plot represents the percentile difference between a new test and a reference test (Y-axis). 
This percentile difference is then plotted against the difference between the two tests (X-axis).   



{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:difference} generates the mountain plot by computing the difference(s) between the first variable specified in {it:varlist} which should
represent the reference test (gold standard) and all other variables in the {it:varlist} (representing one or more new tests). The default
is to generate the mountain plot for each variable specified in {it:varlist} and plot it against that variable's range of values 
on its original scale.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:standardize} transforms the data in {it:varlist} to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This option is 
particularly appropriate when more than one variable is being plotted and the variables are on different scales.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:{it:{help twoway_options:twoway_options}}} allows all available options for twoway graphs.



{title:Examples}

{pstd}Setup {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. use lungfunction.dta}{p_end}

{pstd} Produce a mountain plot for the first of four measurements of lung function in each of 20 schoolchildren (data are from Bland & Altman [1996])  {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1}{p_end}

{pstd} Now plot all four measurements of lung function  {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1 - rating4}{p_end}

{pstd}Same as above but used standardized values for the specified variables {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1 - rating4, stand}{p_end}

{pstd}Produce a mountain plot of the difference between rating1 (reference test) and rating2 (a new test) {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1 rating2, difference}{p_end}

{pstd}Same as above, but plot the difference between rating1 (reference test) and all other ratings (new tests) {p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. mountainplot rating1 - rating4, difference}{p_end}
