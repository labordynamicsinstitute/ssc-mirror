<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>mypkg</b> informs on packages installed with ado, net or ssc and accessible
    to your Stata.
<p>
    With no arguments, <b>mypkg</b> displays a list of packages installed, sorted
    alphabetically by their name and giving the last date installed.  Two or
    more packages with the same name or a package installed more than once
    will by default be listed just once.
<p>
    Given one or more package name patterns, <b>mypkg</b> displays information on
    each such package installed according to the last date installed.  Two or
    more packages with the same name or a package installed more than once
    will by default be listed just once. A pattern includes one or more uses
    of <b>*</b> or <b>?</b> as understood by the <b>match()</b> function.  Thus <b>xt*</b> means all
    names starting with <b>xt</b> and <b>parmes?</b>  means all names which are <b>parmes</b>
    followed by one character.
<p>
    Given one or more package names, <b>mypkg</b> displays information on each
    installed according to the last date installed.  Two or more packages
    with the same name or a package installed more than once will by default
    listed just once.
<p>
    <b>mypkg</b> takes its information from, and depends on the existence of, the
    file <b>stata.trk</b> within what <b>sysdir</b> knows as STBPLUS. (In Stata 8, this is
    equivalent to what <b>sysdir</b> knows as PLUS.)
<p>
 
<b><u>Options</u></b>
 
    <b>all</b> specifies that all packages satisfying the criteria should be shown
        and not just the last installed with each distinct name.
<p>
    <i>list_options</i> are options of list other than <b>noobs</b>.
<p>
