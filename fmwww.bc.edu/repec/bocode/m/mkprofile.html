    <b>mkprofile</b> with no options specified is equivalent to:
<p>
    <b>. mkprofile , memory(40) vlabel(12)</b>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>mkprofile</b> creates or edits your <b>profile.do</b> file.  Your <b>profile.do</b> file
    contains the settings you would like Stata to have every time you start a
    Stata session.  By default, <b>mkprofile</b> creates your <b>profile.do</b> file to set
    your variable label position to 12 and your memory to 40m.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>mem</u></b><b>ory(</b><i> integer </i><b>)</b> sets Stata's memory to that number of megabytes.  Be
        careful not to set it too low or too high as you will get an error
        message when your <b>profile.do</b> file is run.
<p>
    <b><u>vl</u></b><b>abel(</b><i> integer </i><b>)</b> sets the variable label position in the variable label
        window.  If you tend not to have variable names longer than 8 or so
        characters, set it to 10 to allow you to easily see the variable
        label associated to the variable.
<p>
    <b>list</b> specifies <b>mkprofile</b> only to list the directories that your
        <b>profile.do</b> file will be attempted to be created in rather than
        attempt to create or edit your <b>profile.do</b> file.  The order of the
        directories listed will be the reverse order of directories that
        Stata will search for your <b>profile.do</b> file so that the top listed
        directories are more likely the directories you have permission to
        create your <b>profile.do</b> file.  Also specifying the <b>all</b> option will
        make the order be the order of all the directories that Stata
        searches for your <b>profile.do</b> file.
<p>
    <b>all</b> specifies <b>mkprofile</b> to list all the directories that Stata will look
        in for your <b>profile.do</b> file and attempt to create your <b>profile.do</b>
        file in the first of these directories in which it can create it.
        NOTE: These directories may require administrator directory
        permissions.  By default <b>mkprofile</b> only tries to attempt to create
        your <b>profile.do</b> file in a directory you most likely have permission
        to create the file.
<p>
    <b><u>nth</u></b><b>dir(</b><i> integer </i><b>)</b> species in which of the directories listed by <b>mkprofile</b>
        you prefer <b>mkprofile</b> to create your <b>profile.do</b> file.  If not
        specified, <b>mkprofile</b> will create your <b>profile.do</b> file in the first
        directory it can create it in.  NOTE: The <b>all</b> option affects the
        order of the directories so the nth directory will be different if
        <b>all</b> is specified or not specified when using the <b>nthdir()</b> option.
<p>
    <b>edit</b> will allow you to open your current <b>profile.do</b> file in the do-file
        editor.
<p>
    <b>cwd</b> tells Stata to change to the directory you are currently in when you
        invoke <b>mkprofile</b> at the beginning of each Stata session.  Note: "cwd"
        means "current working directory." To use this option, first cd to
        the directory you normally use, then use the <b>cwd</b> option in <b>mkprofile</b>.
        The next time you start Stata, you will be in this directory.  To
        start Stata in a different directory in the future, edit your
        <b>profile.do</b> file.
<p>
    NOTE: An example of how to set-up <b>F</b> keys (eg. <b>F4</b>, <b>F5</b>) on your keyboard to
        be used to change to set directories is implemented in the <b>profile.do</b>
        file using the current directory in the example.  Use macro list to
        see what <b>F</b> keys are already being used.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
        Since Stata only runs the first <b>profile.do</b> file that it finds in its
        search path, there is no guarantee that the <b>profile.do</b> file created
        <b>mkprofile</b> will always be found and run by Stata.  Read more about 
        profile.  <b>mkprofile</b> can be set to have a default location in which to
        create the <b>profile.do</b> file.  For Windows "C:\ado\" is suggested.  For
        Unix/Linux and Macintosh "~/ado/" is suggested.  A preferred
        directory can be set to a specific directory along Stata's search
        path for the <b>profile.do</b> file by editing the <b>mkprofile.ado</b> file.  If a
        preferred directory is set, then this directory will be the only
        directory <b>mkprofile</b> will see as an option to try to create the
        <b>profile.do</b> file even if the <b>all</b> option is specified.
