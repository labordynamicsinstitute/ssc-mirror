<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>mmsel</b> Simulates (counterfactual) distributions from quantile regressions.
    Based on Machado and Mata (2005). An option to correct for sample
    selection has been added, using an adaptation of the procedure described
    in Albrecht et. al (2009). Multiple options available for different
    reference groups, following Oaxaca (1973), Blinder (1973) Oaxaca Ransom
    (1994) and Jann (2008). After simulation of conditional distributions,
    the differences between these distributions are decomposed and graphed
    into explained and unexplained components.
<p>
    To keep working directory clean, the program creates four directories
    (tmp, results, logs, data) which contain all the files needed for
    troubleshooting and/or analysis.
<p>
    WARNING - Depending on options selected, may take days to run - test
    using <b>sample 10</b> or other low number (uses 10% of sample).
<p>
    NOTE - This program requires a pid variable: a personal identification
    variable for each individual in the sample
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
        +------+
    ----+ Main +-------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>pooled/incgrp/group1</b> Reference wage structure:
<p>
    <b>pooled</b> Uses the pooled wage structure estimated from a model using the
        pooled sample (including both groups) (See Oaxaca &amp; Ransom 1994)
<p>
    <b>incgrp</b> Uses the pooled wage structure (including the group binary
        variable) estimated from a model using the pooled sample (including
        both groups) (See Jann(2008))
<p>
    <b>group1</b> Uses the wage structure of group for which that group binary
        variable equals 1 estimated from a model using only that group's
        sample. (If the group binary variable is coded as male=1 male and
        male=0 female, then selecting the group1 option will use as reference
        wage structure the male wage structure) (See Oaxaca (1973) &amp; Blinder
        (1973))
<p>
    <b>percentile</b> Using this option forces the module to provide a table with
        decomposition results for each percentile, rather than the default of
        every 5 percentiles
<p>
    <b>reps(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> Number of repetitions used in the Machado &amp; Mata counterfactual
        distribution simulations (default value: 200)
<p>
        +-----------------------------+
    ----+ Sample Selection Correction +--------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>grponlysel</b> Single group for sample selection correction - Sample
        selection correction only takes place for individuals where the group
        dummy is equal to zero (default is both groups are corrected for
        sample selection)
<p>
    <b>single(</b><i>indepvars</i><b>)</b> Single index generation for sample selection correction
        - This option launches the single index generation process proposed
        by Ichimura (1993), as documented in Albrecht et. al (2009), prior to
        sample selection corrected decompositions. It must ONLY be run on a
        full dataset that includes censored observations. The independent
        variables are variables that are thought to affect whether an
        observation is censored or not. Following the single index generation
        process, censored observations are dropped from the sample. Censored
        observations automatically identified by the option as those
        observations where depvar (in the mmsel) is missing or equal to 0.
<p>
    <b><u>m</u></b><b>ethod(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> (Only for testing purposes) Method of estimation - Whether
        method(1) or method(2) selected the same results should be generated
        (Default setting is method(2)).
<p>
    <b><u>adj</u></b><b>ust(</b><i>var</i><b>)</b> Single index generated power series variable - The variable
        predicted from a single index model applied to the whole working and
        non-working sample, needed for sample selection correction.  The
        Inverse Mills Ratio can also be used although many assumptions must
        be relaxed for this to be a valid move.  NOTE: If the single() option
        is used, "var" MUST be replaced with "Ps1". If not, "var" should be a
        single index generated over the full censored and non-censored
        sample.
<p>
    <b><u>con</u></b><b>straint(</b><i>con</i><b>)</b> Reduced sample constraint - a constraint in Stata format
        with the aim of constraining the sample temporarily to a sample for
        which the probability of being in work is close to unity. This is a
        second-best solution to estimating the true constant of an earnings
        equation while correcting for sample selection across the earnings
        distribution
<p>
    <b><u>red</u></b><b>uced(</b><i>indepvars</i><b>)</b> Reduced model - List of independent variables without
        the variable(s) used for the sample constraint above.
<p>
<b><u>Example without sample selection correction</u></b>
<p>
        <b>. mmsel y x1 x2 x3 x4, group(female) filename(foo) reps(100) pooled</b>
<p>
<b><u>Example with sample selection correction</u></b>
<p>
        <b>. mmsel y x1 x2 x3 x4, group(female) grponlysel single(z1 z2 z3)</b>
            <b>filename(foo) reps(100) pooled adjust(Ps1) reduced(x1 x3)</b>
            <b>cons(x2=1&amp;x4&lt;56|x2=0&amp;x4&lt;24)</b>
