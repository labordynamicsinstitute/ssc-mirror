Scatter plots with multiple x and y variables
---------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^muxyplot^ yvars xvars [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    [ ^,^ graph_options ^l^ink ^n^eed^(^string^)^ ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^muxyplot^ produces a scatter or twoway plot for yvars versus xvars,
all of which xvars are measured on comparable scales. The number of
yvars must equal the number of xvars. For example,
<p>
^muxyplot^ y1 y2 y3 x1 x2 x3
<p>
plots y1 versus x1, y2 versus x2 and y3 versus x3, all on the same
scatter plot.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^. ^connect^ and
^symbol^ refer to the y-axis variables. Note that
<p>
    1. ^connect(||)^ and ^connect(II)^ are either unusable or
    irrelevant.
<p>
    2. ^sy([_n])^ does not work properly. Instead do something like
<p>
    ^gen id = _n^
    ^muxyplot^ ... ^, sy(...[id]...) need(id)^
<p>
    3. As exemplified above, any variables named in options should also
    be specified in the ^need^ option.
<p>
^link^ connects each sequence of data points for each observation
    (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ... by a segmented straight line. For
    example, if each pair of variables refers to a specific time, then
    the trajectory of an individual over time may be shown in this way.
    ^link^ may not be combined with ^connect()^.
<p>
^need(^string^)^ specifies variables needed by options and not mentioned
    before the options. (Otherwise, those variables would be lost by the
    ^stack^ included in ^muxyplot^.) Two or more variable names should
    be separated by spaces.
<p>
<p>
Limitation
----------
<p>
^by( ) link total^ is allowed as a combination of  options but is not
guaranteed to produce a correct ^total^ graph, because sorting first on
the ^by( )^ variable may have the side-effect of producing spurious
connections between data points.
