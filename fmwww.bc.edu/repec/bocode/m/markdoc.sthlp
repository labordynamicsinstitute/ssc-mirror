{title:Instalation} 

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:MarkDoc} can be installed using the SSC server, which hosts the latest stable release of MarkDoc. The SSC installation is as follows:

{p 8 8 2}
. {bf:ssc install markdoc}{break}

{p 4 4 2}
Alternatively, advanced users may wish for the current developing version (pre-release) which can be downloaded from {browse "http://github.com/haghish/MarkDoc":GitHub}:

{p 8 8 2}
. {bf:net install markdoc, force  from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haghish/markdoc/master/)}{break}

{p 4 4 2}
After installing MarkDoc, install {help Weaver} and {help Statax} as follows. If the {cmd:install}
option is specified, MarkDoc checkes for the required packages and installs them automatically, if they're not already installed.

{title:Description} 

{pstd}
{bf:markdoc} is a general-purpose literate programming package for Stata that 
produces {it:dynamic analysis documents}, {it:package vignette documentation}, 
{it:dynamic presentation slides}, as well as dynamic 
{it:Stata package help files}. 

{pstd}
For creating a dynamic document or presentation slides, MarkDoc requires a smcl 
log-file as input and converts it to other formats. For generating dynamic Stata 
help files or package vignette documentation, MarkDoc requires a Stata script-file 
(do, ado, mata) as input and exports the documentations written within the source. 
Visit MarkDoc homepage for documentation about generating 
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/markdoc.php#sthlp":{bf:dynamic Stata help files and documentations}}. 

{pstd}
MarkDoc supports 
three different markup languages which are 
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/dynamic_documents/markdown.php":Markdown}, 
{browse "http://haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/dynamic_documents/htmlcodes.php":HTML}, 
and {browse "http://haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/dynamic_documents/latex.php":LaTeX}. 
All of these markup languages can also include an image in the document, support 
writing dynamic text, and creating dynamic table. MarkDoc can export documents 
in various file formats including {bf:pdf} document and {bf:slide}, Microsoft Office {bf:docx}, 
Open Office and LibreOffice {bf:odt}, LaTeX {bf:tex}, {bf:html}, {bf:epub}, 
Markdown {bf:md}, {bf:slidy} and {bf:dzslide} HTML-based slides, and also 
{bf:sthlp} and {bf:smcl} for Stata documentation. If file format is not specified, MarkDoc creates a 
markdown {bf:md} file. MarkDoc {help weaver:requires the Weaver package} for 
making use of the {help txt}, {help tbl}, and {help img} commands which are used for writing 
dynamic text, creating dynamic tables, and importing figures automatically 
in the document, respectively. MarkDoc also  
{help statax:requires the Statax package} which provides 
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statax/statax.php":a JavaScript syntax highlighter for Stata and Mata code}
 in HTML and PDF documents.

{pstd}
MarkDoc creates the dynamic documents by converting {it:smcl} log-file to other 
file formats mentioned above or parsing the documentation written in Stata script files. 
The documentation should be written within the 
source files using a special notations that are seperated from regular 
comments. Weaving the dynamic document or dynamic slides 
can take place at any point without 
requiring closing the log-file, which provides live-preview of the document. This 
is the biggest advantage of MarkDoc and {help Weaver} packages to other classic literate 
programming packages which cannot provide live-preview of the document in an 
interactive analysis session. 

{pstd}
MarkDoc supports both Stata and {help Mata:Mata} languages. Therefore, advanced users who work or 
program in Mata, can use Markdoc - with the same syntax and markup notation - 
to produce a dynamic document or slides, or document their programs. The same source 
that is used for generating dynamic Stata {bf:sthlp} help files, can be used to 
produce Microsoft Word {bf:docx}, {bf:pdf}, etc.

{pstd}
For a more detailed documentation and examples, visit 
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/markdoc.php":{bf:MarkDoc Homepage}}. 


{title:Inserting an image or figure in the document}

{pstd}
Any of the supported markup languages can be used to insert a figure in the 
document. In general, there are two ways for inserting an image in the document. 
First, you can use Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX syntax for inserting an image {hline 2} 
that is already saved in your hard drive {hline 2} in the document. The other solution is using {help img} command. 
{cmd:img} command can take the {help filename} of exsisting image on the hard 
drive and print the markup code (Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX. the default is 
Markdown) int he document. {cmd:img} command can also auto-export the current 
graph and import it in the document. For more information in this regard see 
the {help img:img help file} and also 
{ul:{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/markdoc.php#img":Examples and explanations on MarkDoc homepage}}


{title:Writing dynamic text}

{pstd}
the {help txt:{bf:txt}} command is borrowed from {help weaver} package to print 
dynamic text in the the exported dynamic document. 
It can be used for interpreting the analysis results or dynamically referring to values of 
scalars or macros in the dynamic document. Writing dynamic text allows the content of 
the text to change by altering 
analysis codes and thus is the desirable way for explaining the analysis results. The text and 
macros can be styled using any of the supported markup languages in MarkDoc which are 
{it:markdown}, {it:LaTeX}, and {it:HTML}. This command is fully documented in 
the {help txt:txt help file}. 


{title:Creating dynamic tables with tbl command}

{pstd}
the {help tbl:{bf:tbl}} command also belongs to {help weaver} package. The syntax of this command
is similar to {help matrix input}, however, it can include {it:String}, digits, 
scalars, and macros to create a dynamic table. This command is fully documented in 
the {help tbl:tbl help file}.


{title:Markers} 

{p 4 4 2}In addition to 3 markup languages, MarkDoc also introduces a few handy 
markers for annotating the smcl log-file. These markers can be used to specify what 
parts of the log-file should not appear in the dynamic document. The 
table below provides a brief summary of these annotating markers. In general, 
comments - unless they appear after a command - will be ignored in the dynamic 
document. However, the markers mentioned below are "special comments" that will 
influence the MarkDoc process. {break} 
 
 
{synoptset 30}{...}
{marker marker}
{p2col:{it:Marker}}Description{p_end}
{synoptline}

{syntab:{ul:Creating text block}}

{synopt :{bf: /*** }}{p_end}
{synopt : ...}creates a block of comments in the smcl file that will be interpreted in the dynamic document {p_end}
{synopt :{bf: ***/}}


{syntab:{ul:Hiding command or output}}

{synopt :{bf: /**/} {it:command} }only include the {bf:output} in the dynamic document {p_end}
{synopt :{bf: /***/} {it:command} }only include the {bf:command} in the dynamic document {p_end}


{syntab:{ul:Hiding a section}}

{synopt :{bf: //OFF }}{p_end}
{synopt : ... }Anything placed after "{bf://OFF}" until "{bf://ON} markers will be {bf:ignored} in the dynamic document {p_end}
{synopt :{bf: //ON}}


{syntab:{ul:Appending external files}}

{synopt :{bf: //IMPORT} {help filename} }Append external text file (Markdown, HTML, LaTeX) to the dynamic document{p_end}

{synoptline}
{p2colreset}{...}

{p 4 4 2}Apart from the writing markers "{bf: /*** }" and "{bf: ***/ }", which 
are used for writing text, the other markers {bf:are not supported within loops}. 
Simply because smcl log-file does not print the output after each command in the loop. 
Nonetheless, writing markup text within the loop is not recommended either because 
it only gets printed once. For active writing within the loop or a program, see the 
{help txt} command or {help weaver} package. {break}


{title:Writing text in the do-file}
 
{pstd}
As noted, MarkDoc package allows writing and styling text as a comment in the do file. 
Text can be placed between "{bf:/***}" and "{bf:***/}" signs, where these signs are placed 
on separate lines individually. Here is an example:

    {bf:    /***} 
	
    {bf:    Text heading} 
    {bf:    ============} 
    
    {bf:    subheading}
    {bf:    ----------} 
    
    {bf:    When you write a dynamic document in MarkDoc, place text between}
    {bf:    the "/***" and "***/" signs. But they should be placed on separate lines,}
    {bf:    as shown in this example.}
		
    {bf:    ***/}

{pstd}  
	
	
{title:Hiding commands in dynamic document}

{pstd}
Use "{bf:/**/}" sign before each Stata command to hide it from the document. However, 
this sign does not hide the command outputs, but only the command itself.

{phang} Here is an example:

    {bf:  /**/} {it:sysuse auto} 
    {bf:  /**/} {it:regress price mpg} 


{title:Hiding output in dynamic document}

{pstd}
Use "{bf:/***/}" sign before each Stata command to hide its output in the 
dynamic document. However, this sign does not hide the command itself, 
but only the output. In contrast to {help quietly} command which hides 
the output in the smcl log, the "{bf:/***/}" sign only eliminates the 
output in the dynamic document and the output will be registered in the smcl log file.
Using this marker is very similar to the example above.


{title:Hiding a large part of the smcl file}

{pstd}
If you want to register several commands and outputs in the smcl log, but you wish 
to remove them from the dynamic document, begin the section you wish to hide with 
"{bf://OFF}" on a separate line as shown below. MarkDoc will ignore anything that 
comes after this marker until you specify "{bf://ON}" marker which will continue 
interpreting the smcl log. In contrast to turning the {help log:log off} and {help log:log on}
for ignoring part of the code in the document, these markers allow you to save 
everything in the log file and yet, exclude them in the dynamic document. Note 
that these markers cannot be written in Stata interactively and should be placed 
or run from the do file. 

{phang}{c 29} {cmd:  //OFF}

    {bf:  {it:command}} 
    {bf:  {it:command}} 
    {bf:  ... }
    
    {bf:  //ON}


{title:Supported markup languages}

{pstd}
MarkDoc supports three markup languages which are 
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/dynamic_documents/markdown.php":Markdown}, 
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/dynamic_documents/htmlcodes.php":HTML}, and
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/dynamic_documents/latex.php":LaTeX}. 
Whereas writing with Markdown allows exporting the document in any format (including HTML 
and LaTeX), writing with HTML or LaTeX requires exporting the document in {bf:PDF} or {bf:html} and  
{bf:tex} format respectively. Markup languages hould not be used together in one document because 
MarkDoc process each markup language differently.


{title:Markdown syntax}

{pstd}
Writing with Markdown can make your script files appealing. It is a fairly minimalistic 
language which makes your text distinguishable from the computer code, in contrast 
to HTML and LaTeX, which add to the complexity of the code. 
To learn about using Markdown syntax for styling text and importing graphs, see 
{browse "http://haghish.com/statistics/stata-blog/reproducible-research/dynamic_documents/markdown.php":Writing with Markdown in Stata}.


{title:Linesize}

{pstd}
Users can alter the linesize of the dynamic document using the {opt linesize(int)}
option. The value of the linesize can range from 80 to 255. 
If you wish to export your smcl logfile to {bf:Microsoft Word docx} format, note that 
Microsoft Word documents have a large left and right margin and you should reduce the 
margins of the Word document manually or alternatively reduce the font size. 


{title:Software Installation}
{psee}

{marker sof}{...}
{pstd}
The MarkDoc package requires additional software which can be installed manually or 
automatically. The required software are 
{browse "http://pandoc.org/":Pandoc} and 
{browse "http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html":wkhtmltopdf} driver. They are both 
opensource freeware, supported for any common operating system such as Microsoft Windows, 
Macintosh, and Linux. Naturally, users who wish to use LaTeX markup for writing 
the documentation, will need a 
{browse "https://latex-project.org/ftp.html":TeX distribution with pdfLaTeX}. 

{pstd}
After a manual installation, the path to executable Pandoc should be specified in 
{opt pan:doc(str)} option. Similarly, the path to executable wkhtmltopdf or pdfLaTeX 
should be given to {opt print:er(str)} option. Note that the {opt print:er(str)} option 
is only needed for compiling {bf:pdf} document. 

{pstd}
With automatic installation (i.e. using the {opt install} option), Pandoc and Wkhtmltopdf are downloaded and placed
in Weaver directory which is located in /ado/plus/Weaver/ on your machine. To find the 
location of ado/plus/ directory on your machine use the 
{help sysdir} command which returns the system directories. The usual complete
paths to the Weaver directory are shown below. Note that username refers to your machine's username.

{p 8 8 2}{bf:Windows:} {it:C:\ado\plus\Weaver} 

{p 8 8 2}{bf:Macintosh:} {it:/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Stata/ado/plus/Weaver} 

{p 8 8 2}{bf:Unix:} {it:/home/username/ado/plus/Weaver}


{title:Set file paths permanently}
{psee}

{pstd}
After manual installation, the paths to the executable Pandoc, wkhtmltopdf, and pdfLaTeX can be permanently set using {cmd: weave setup} command. This command will open {it:weaversetup.ado} document, where you can define the files paths as global macros.

{phang}{cmd:  weave setup}


{marker trouble}{...}
{title:Software troubleshoot}

{pstd}
As mentioned, the required software can be installed manually or automatically. 
The optional automatic installation is expected to 
work properly in Microsoft Windows {bf:XP}, Windows {bf:7}, and Windows {bf:8.1}, Macintosh  
{bf:OSX 10.9.5}, Linux {bf:Mint 17 Cinnamon} (32bit & 64bit), Ubuntu {bf:14} (64bit), and 
{bf:CentOS 7} (64bit). Other operating systems may require manual software installation. 

{pstd}
However, if for some technical or permission reasons MarkDoc fails to download, access, or run 
Pandoc, install it manually and provide the 
file path to Pandoc using {opt pan:doc(str)} option. visit 
{browse "http://www.haghish.com/packages/pandoc.php":Installing Pandoc for Stata packages}  
for more information regarding manual installation of Pandoc. 


{title:Calling Pandoc}

{pstd}
{help Pandoc: Pandoc commands can also be executed from Stata}. This command takes the path to 
the executable Pandoc from MarkDoc and allows you to use Pandoc seamlessly for converting 
files within Stata 

    {bf:  pandoc ./example.tex -o ./example.html}
	

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
If the log-file is closed exactly using "{bf:qui log c}" command, Markdoc automatically removes 
this command from the end of the file. 

{pstd}
Similarly, MarkDoc removes "{bf:qui log off}" from the logfile. Therefore "{bf:qui log off}" 
and "{bf:qui log on}" can be used to separate codes in the dofile that are not wanted in the 
dynamic document, but still required in for the analysis. Nonetheless, this is not a 
proper practice and can harm the transparency of the analytic session. The log-file 
should include as much information about the history of the analysis as possible. 
Use the "Markers" for hiding sections of the log-file in the dynamic document.
