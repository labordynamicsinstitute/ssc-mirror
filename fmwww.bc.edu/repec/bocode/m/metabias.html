<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>metabias</b> performs updated regression tests for funnel-plot asymmetry in
meta-analysis.  The Harbord test regresses Z/sqrt(V) against sqrt(V), where Z
is the efficient score and V is Fisher's information (the variance of Z under
the null hypothesis).  The Peters test regresses the intervention effect
estimate on 1/n with weights dh/n, where n is the total sample size, d is the
number experiencing the event and h is the number not experiencing the event.
These may be calculated for the log-odds or log-risk ratio, from 2x2 tables of
binary outcomes.
<p>
The Egger test is also implemented, and performs a linear regression of the
intervention effect estimates on their standard errors, weighting by
1/(variance of the intervention effect estimate).  The latter is recommended
for intervention effects measured as mean differences, but can suffer from
false-positive test results when analysing odds ratios due to the mathematical
association between the log odds ratio and its standard error.  For
completeness, the Begg test is also implemented; although this is widely
accepted to be redundant as it suffers the same statistical problems as the
Egger test but has lower power.
<p>
<i>varlist</i> should contain either four or two variables. When four variables are
given these are assumed to be cell counts for the 2x2 table in the order cases
and non-cases for the experimental group followed by cases and non-cases for
the control group, i.e., <i>d1 h1 d0 h0</i>, as in metan.  When two variables are
specified these are assumed to be the effect estimate and its standard error,
i.e., <i>theta se_theta</i>; it is recommended that ratio-based effect estimates are
log-transformed as for metan.

<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>egger peters harbord begg</b> requests that the original Egger test, the Peters
    test, or Harbord’s modified test be used. Note that there is no default:
    one test must be chosen, and only one test.
<p>
<b>graph</b> displays a Galbraith plot (the standard normal deviate of intervention
    effect estimate against its precision) for the original Egger test, or a
    modified Galbraith plot of Z / sqrt(V) vs. sqrt(V) for Harbord’s modified
    test. Note that there is no corresponding Galbraith plot for the Peters
    test.
<p>
<b>nofit</b> suppresses the fitted regression line and confidence interval around the
    intercept.
<p>
<b>or</b> uses odds ratios as the effect estimate of interest (the default)
<p>
<b>rr</b> specifies that risk ratios be used rather than odds ratios.  Note that this
    is not available for the Peters test.
<p>
<b>level(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence intervals
    of the coefficients. The default is the user-specified default contained in
    level (which, in turn, is by default 95%).
<p>
<i>graph_options</i> are options allowed by twoway_scatter.  In particular, options
    for specifying marker labels may well be useful; see marker_label_options.
    legend<b>(off)</b> is another possibility.

<b><u>History and note on dialog box</u></b>
<p>
This version of <b>metabias</b> revises and extends the previous package by Thomas
Steichen first released as sbe19 in STB 41 and updated through to sbe19.5.  We
are grateful for Tom's permission to release this version under the same name.
The previous program is included in the present package as metabias6, which
unlike the revised version has an accompanying dialog box.
