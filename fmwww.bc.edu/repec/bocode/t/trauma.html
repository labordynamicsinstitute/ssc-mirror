<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>db trauma</b> -- ICD-9-CM Trauma
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Version</u></b>
<p>
    Version 3.0.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  ICDPIC Version 3.0 has
    been tested in STATA 10 and STATA 11, but the authors believe it should
    also work without incident in STATA 8 and STATA 9.  If you have any
    problems using ICDPIC Version 3.0 in STATA 8 or STATA 9, please inform
    the authors.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 may be installed from within STATA using the <b>ssc</b>
    command.  If you installed a previous version of ICDPIC from the SSC
    archives website using the <b>ssc</b> command, we suggest that you first delete
    it by typing <b>ssc uninstall icdpic</b> followed by <b>ssc install icdpic</b>.
    Alternatively, you may use <b>ssc install icdpic, replace</b>.  See help for 
    ssc.
<p>
    If you installed any previous ICDPIC files obtained directly from the
    authors, please delete them <b>ALL</b> (.ado, .hlp and .dta files) to avoid any
    conflicts with ICDPIC 3.0 files.
<p>
    Please enter complete variable names in the ICDPIC Version 3.0 dialog
    boxes.  Do not use abbreviations.
<p>
    New to Version 3.0 is the addition of a dialog box (.dlg) file associated
    with each individual ICDPIC Version 3.0 program (.ado) file.  To access
    the ICDPIC dialog box, and all the ICDPIC programs, type: <b>db icdpic</b>.
    Typing <b>icdpic</b>, as in earlier versions, will still work, but <b>ONLY</b> with
    <b>icdpic</b>.  For example, to access the ICD-9-CM Trauma program directly,
    type: <b>db trauma</b>.  Typing <b>trauma</b>, as in previous versions, will produce an
    error.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to use path\file names
    containing spaces.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to run in STATA 11.0.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is a bug that caused the <b>triss</b> program to
    crash if the <i>rts</i> variable was named anything other than "rts".
<p>
    New in ICDPIC Version 3.0 (<b>trauma</b> program only) is the ability to choose
    whether an AIS value of 6 automatically forces an ISS of 75 or to
    automatically have all AIS values of 6 changed to an AIS value of 5 and
    then have the ISS calculated normally.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have memory.  Each time a dialog
    box is opened within the same STATA session, it will remember the values
    last entered.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have the following buttons:
<p>
      <i>OK</i> executes the program and removes the dialog box from the screen.
<p>
      <i>SUBMIT</i> executes the program and leaves the dialog box on the screen.
             Note that if an error message is generated the dialog box may be
             minimized.
<p>
      <i>CANCEL</i> removes the dialog box from the screen and does nothing.
             Clicking on the close icon of the dialog box does the same
             thing.
<p>
      <i>HELP</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and presents the program help
           file.  The <i>HELP</i> button has a question mark on it.
<p>
      <i>COPY</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and copies the program command
           to the clipboard.
<p>
      <i>RESET</i> resets the values of the controls in the dialog box to their
            initial state, just as if the dialog box were invoked for the
            first time.  Each time a user invokes a dialog box, its controls
            will be filled in with the values the user last entered.  <i>RESET</i>
            restores the control values to their defaults.  The <i>RESET</i> button
            has an R on it.
<p>

<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>trauma</b> provides various classifications and characterizations of trauma
    based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, specifically codes for Nature of
    Injury (N-Codes) and External Cause of Injury (E-Codes).
<p>
    For each observation, for each valid N-Code, variables for data from the
    list below will be added to the user's data.  Note: variables for
    diagnosis codes that are not valid N-Codes will have missing values.
<p>
<p>
        Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) value
        ISS body region
        Barell body region by nature of injury diagnosis matrix category
        Anatomic profile component category
<p>
<p>
    Variables for 4 E-Codes will be added to the user's data for each
    observation.  Up to 4 valid E-Codes, excluding E-Code places (E849.X),
    will be taken from the diagnosis codes and placed in these variables.
    Variables for data from the list below will be added to the user's data
    for each of the 4 E-Code variables.  Note: E-Code, and associated,
    variables for which there is not an E-Code will have missing values.
<p>
<p>
        CDC Classifications for E-Codes (Mechanism, both major and minor, and
            Intent)
<p>
<p>
    For each observation, variables for data from the list below will be
    added to the user's data.
<p>
<p>
        Maximum AIS severity for each ISS body region
        Maximum AIS severity overall
        Injury Severity Score (ISS)
        New Injury Severity Score (NISS)
        Lowest CDC classification of external cause of injury mechanism for
            all E-Codes captured
        Trauma type (Blunt or Penetrating)
<p>
<p>
    See also the <b>Options</b> and <b>Remarks</b> sections for <b>IMPORTANT</b> information on,
    and requirements for, <b>trauma</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in the user's data may, or may not, contain a
    decimal point.  Simply choose the option that applies to your data in the
    <i>ICD-9-CM Trauma</i> dialog box.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    The user's data must contain ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes.  Diagnosis codes
    in the user's data must be of type string.  A decimal point in the
    diagnosis codes is optional.  Diagnosis codes should have a width of 5 (6
    if a decimal point is present).  The diagnosis code prefix must be the
    same for all diagnosis codes and numbered sequentially starting with 1,
    for example, dx1...dxN.  External Cause of Injury codes (E-Codes) should
    be included in this set and must begin with a capital 'E'.
<p>
    <b>trauma</b> adds the following variables, where appropriate, to a new copy of
    the user's data stored on disk:
<p>
<p>
        <i>sev_1-sev_n</i>: AIS severity for diagnosis codes 1..n
        <i>issbr_1-issbr_n</i>: ISS body region for diagnosis codes 1..n
        <i>brl_1-brl_n</i>: Barell matrix category for diagnosis codes 1..n
        <i>apc_1-apc_n</i>: anatomic profile component category for diagnosis codes
            1..n
        <i>mxaisbr1-mxaisbr6</i>: maximum AIS severity for each ISS body region
        <i>maxais</i>: maximum AIS severity over all ISS body regions
        <i>xiss</i>: computed injury severity score
        <i>niss</i>: computed new injury severity score
        <i>ecode_1-ecode_4</i>: up to 4 E-Codes are captured excluding E-Code places
            (E849.X)
        <i>mechmaj1-mechmaj4</i>: CDC external cause of injury major mechanism for
            each E-Code captured
        <i>mechmin1-mechmin4</i>: CDC external cause of injury minor mechanism for
            each E-Code captured
        <i>intent1-intent4</i>: intent for each E-Code captured
        <i>lowmech</i>: lowest CDC external cause of injury major mechanism for all
            E-Codes captured
        <i>bluntpen</i>: type of trauma, blunt or penetrating, based on value of
            variable <i>mechmaj1</i>
<p>
<p>
    If a diagnosis code is not an N-Code, then its associated <i>sev</i>, <i>issbr</i>, <i>brl</i>
    and <i>apc</i> variables will contain missing values.
<p>
    <i>mxaisbr1-mxaisbr6</i> variables are defined as 0 if there are no valid
    N-Codes for that body region and 9 if there are no valid N-Codes with a
    known severity for that body region.
<p>
    The <i>maxais</i> variable is defined as 0 if there are no valid N-Codes and 9
    if there are no valid N-Codes with a known severity.
<p>
    The <i>xiss</i> and <i>niss</i> variables are defined as 75 if <i>maxais</i> is 6.  If there
    are no valid N-Codes, then they are defined as 0.  If there are no valid
    N-Codes with both a known severity and a known body region, then they are
    defined as 99.
<p>
    If an E-Code variable (<i>ecode_1-e_code4</i>) does not contain an E-Code then
    it, and its associated variables, (<i>mechmaj, mechmin and intent</i>) will
    contain missing values.
<p>
    The <i>bluntpen</i> variable is defined as follows:  P for penetrating trauma if
    the <i>mechmaj1</i> variable is 0 or 4 and; B for blunt trauma if the <i>mechmaj1</i>
    variable is 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 13.
<p>
    Nature of Injury Codes (N-Codes) included in both <b>ntab_s1.dta</b> and
    <b>ntab_s2.dta</b>:
<p>
<p>
        800 - 904.9
        910 - 929.9
        940 - 957.9 (Note: burns, 940 - 949.5, are assigned AIS severity code
            9 (Unknown))
        959 - 959.9
 
<p>
    <b>trauma</b> requires the use of lookup tables <b>ntab_s1.dta</b>, <b>ntab_s2.dta</b>,
    <b>etab_s1.dta</b> and <b>etab_s2.dta</b>.  These data tables are supplied.  _s1 tables
    are for use with data without the decimal point in ICD-9-CM codes and _s2
    tables are for data that include the decimal point.  See help for icdpic,
    specifically the LOOKUP TABLES part of the <b>Remarks</b> section.
<p>
<p>
    <b><u>NOTES ON METHODOLOGY</u></b>
<p>
    <b>trauma</b> does not attempt to assign a specific AIS code for each N-Code,
    but only to classify injuries into a general severity and body region in
    order to allow for approximate severity scoring.  Meredith and colleagues
    have pointed out that any mapping method will be less accurate than
    direct AIS coding by trained registrars, but a program like ICDPIC (or
    ICDMAP-90) may be useful when the latter is impractical or impossible.
    For calculation of severity scores, only the original version of the
    Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) was used, as developed and published by
    the American Medical Association.  Later versions of the AIS, with more
    body regions and updated definitions, have been developed by the American
    Association for Automotive Medicine, and are available from that
    organization.  ICDPIC does not calculate these newer versions of the AIS.
<p>
    Injury Severity Score (variable <i>xiss</i> in the output data) is calculated
    according to the classic description of Baker and colleagues, but only
    over codes that have both a known severity and body region.
<p>
<p>
    <b><u>NOTES ON VALIDATION</u></b>
<p>
    To a large extent, the ICD to AIS mapping is "self-validating", since it
    reflects the consensus of a large number of registrars with actual
    specific injuries.  An interesting review of this general approach to
    decision making is given in Surowiecki's recent book on the "Wisdom of
    Crowds".
<p>
    ISS calculated by ICDPIC (XISS in Table 1 below) was compared to that
    calculated by ICDMAP-90 (ISS90 in Table 1 below) for 300,176 cases in the
    2002 NIS with a primary diagnosis of injury as defined above, excluding
    cases with a primary burn diagnosis.  In 4,458 of these (1.5%), ICDMAP-90
    was unable to assign an AIS score for any diagnosis.
<p>
    For 248,825 of the remaining 295,718 cases in the 2002 NIS (84.1%), XISS
    was exactly the same as the ISS90 assigned by ICDMAP-90.  When ISS was
    categorized as recommended by Copes and colleagues, 274,709 cases (92.9%)
    were assigned to the same category, and 294,358 (99.5%) to the same or an
    adjacent category (Table 1).

<p>
<p>
    Evaluating the most obvious discrepancies in Table 1, we discovered that
    the 60 cases given ISS90 of 50-75 by ICDMAP-90, but only XISS of 9-24 by
    ICDPIC, were entirely due to the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 862.9 (open
    chest injury, not otherwise specified).  Conversely, the 40 cases given
    ISS90 of 1-8 by ICDMAP-90, but XISS of 25-40 by ICDPIC, were mostly those
    where an injury region was ambiguous between head and face (and therefore
    not coded by ICDMAP-90), but had been assigned an AIS of 5 by
    contributors to NTDB (and therefore by ICDPIC).
