Percent calculation prior to ^table^
----------------------------------
<p>
    ^tablepc^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [weight], ^g^enerate^(^newvar^)^ 
    [ ^by(^byvarlist^)^ ]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^tablepc^ is a utility for calculating percents prior to their display   
by ^table^. ^table^ will not show percents through any built-in option, 
but it will show them if supplied with an appropriate variable generated 
beforehand. The varlist specified to ^tablepc^ should be that which is 
to be specified immediately afterwards to ^table^. 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
This is just a work-around possibly useful so long as ^table^ does not 
support direct display of percents. 
<p>
The advantages of ^table^ over ^tabulate^ include specification of format 
and being able to include a wider variety of summary measures. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^generate(^newvar^)^ specifies the name of the new variable to hold 
    percents. It is a required option. 
<p>
^by(^byvarlist^)^ will usually specify a single variable defining groups 
    for separate calculation of percents. Commonly, this will be the 
    variable which will go on the rows or the columns of the table. 
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
    Table percents: compare  
<p>
    . ^tablepc foreign rep78, gen(pc)^
    . ^table foreign rep78, c(sum pc) format(%2.1f)^  
<p>
    with 
<p>
    . ^tab foreign rep78, cell nofreq^ 
    
    Row percents: compare  
<p>
    . ^tablepc foreign rep78, by(foreign) gen(pc1)^
    . ^table foreign rep78, c(sum pc1) format(%2.1f)^  
<p>
    with 
<p>
    . ^tab foreign rep78, row nofreq^   
    
    Column percents: compare  
<p>
    . ^tablepc foreign rep78, by(rep78) gen(pc2)^
    . ^table foreign rep78, c(sum pc2) format(%2.1f)^  
<p>
    with 
<p>
    . ^tab foreign rep78, col nofreq^
