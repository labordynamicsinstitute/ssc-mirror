        <b><u>tabmenu1</u></b> [<i>varlist</i>] [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>] [<b>,</b> <b><u>clear</u></b> <b><u>d</u></b><b>isplay</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
A command with menus for preparing one or two-way tables of means, geometric
means, medians, proportions, odds, or rates. Frequencies and
confidence intervals can be included as an option. The interquartile
range is reported when medians are selected.
<p>
The command produces a menu in which to specify
<p>
<b> The response variable</b>            often known as the outcome variable
<b> The type of response</b>             metric/binary/failure/count
<b> The follow-up time</b>               if appropriate
<b> The first explanatory variable</b>     determining the rows of the table
<b> The second explanatory variable</b>    determining the columns, if required.
<p>
When a varlist is specified, only those variables in the varlist are
included in the menus.
<p>
As default, explanatory variables with more than 10 values are not 
allowed when making tables, but this can be changed in the menu. 
<p>
Selecting <b> tables</b> produces a sub-menu in which to specify the 
nature of the summary required according to the response: 
<p>
<b>metric</b>          means/geometric means/medians
<b>binary</b>          proportions/odds
<b>failure</b>         rates
<b>count</b>           rates
<p>
This sub-menu gives the opportunity to change the units for
proportions  and for rates to per #. It also gives
the opportunity to choose to display frequencies, to display confidence
intervals, to change level of confidence, and to reverse the rows and
columns of the table.
<p>
When the <b>display</b> option is used the program displays <b>tabmenu2</b>, a
command-line version of <b>tabmenu1</b>, which can be pasted into the
command window, or a do file, and which will produce the same table as
the one just produced by <b>tabmenu1</b>. 
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
