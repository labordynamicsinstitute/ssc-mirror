<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>triprobit</b> estimates simulated maximum-likelihood three-equation probit models
using the GHK smooth recursive simulator.
<p>
The simulated maximum likelihood technique consists in simulating the
multivariate normal integrals which are involved in the likelihhod equation.
The simulated probabilities are fed into the likelihood function which is then
maximized using traditional techniques. See Greene (2000, pp 184-185) for a
description of the simulation algorithm used here.
<p>
<b>triprobit</b> performs a likelihood-ratio test of no correlation between the
equations.
<p>
<b>Warning</b>: due to the estimation technique, convergence can be <b>very</b> slow in large
samples (and/or with a large number of draws)
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>robust</b> specifies that the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance is to be
    used in place of the traditional calculation; see <b>[U] 23.11 Obtaining</b>
    <b>robust variance estimates</b>.  <b>robust</b> combined with <b>cluster()</b> allows
    observations which are not independent within cluster (although they must
    be independent between clusters).  If you specify pweights, <b>robust</b> is
    implied.
<p>
<b>cluster(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies that the observations are independent across groups
    (clusters) but not necessarily within groups.  <i>varname</i> specifies to which
    group each observation belongs; e.g., <b>cluster(personid)</b> in data with
    repeated observations on individuals.  See <b>[U] 23.11 Obtaining robust</b>
    <b>variance estimates</b>.  <b>cluster()</b> can be used with pweights to produce
    estimates for unstratified cluster-sampled data.  Specifying <b>cluster()</b>
    implies <b>robust</b>.
<p>
<b>draws</b> specifies the number of draws to be used in the simulation process.
    Default is 25, which is usually considered as a reasonable number of draws
    to make.
<p>
<b>seed</b> specifies the seed to be set in the simulation process, default is
    123456789
<p>
<b>noinit</b> prevents that parameters values from three independant probits are
    specified as starting values for the estimation process.
<p>
<i>maximize_options</i> control the maximization process; see help maximize.
<p>
<b><u>Saved results</u></b>
<p>
In addition to the results saved by <b>maximize</b> (see <b>[R] maximize</b>), <b>triprobit</b> also
    saves the following results.
<p>
 
<b>e(ll_c)</b> stores the likelihood value of the comparison model
<p>
<b>e(chi2_c)</b> stores the chi2 statistic of the LR test against the comparison model
<p>
<b>e(rho12)</b> stores the estimated correlation coefficient between equation 1 and
    equation 2
<p>
<b>e(rho12_se)</b> stores the estimated standard-error of the correlation coefficient
    between equation 1 and equation 2
<p>
<b>e(rho13)</b> stores the estimated correlation coefficient between equation 1 and
    equation 3
<p>
<b>e(rho13_se)</b> stores the estimated standard-error of the correlation coefficient
    between equation 1 and equation 3
<p>
<b>e(rho23)</b> stores the estimated correlation coefficient between equation 2 and
    equation 3
<p>
<b>e(rho23_se)</b> stores the estimated standard-error of the correlation coefficient
    between equation 2 and equation 3
<p>
<b>e(draws)</b> stores the number of draws used in the simulation
<p>
<b>e(seed)</b> stores the seed which is set for the simulation
<p>
<b>e(depvar)</b> stores the names of the dependat variables
<p>
<b>e(cmd)</b> stores the command name (i.e: <i>triprobit</i>)
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Note</u></b>
<p>
rho12 represents the correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 2
<p>
rho13 represents the correlation coefficient between equation 1 and equation 3
<p>
rho23 represents the correlation coefficient between equation 2 and equation 3
<p>
