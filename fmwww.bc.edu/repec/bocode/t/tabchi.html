Two-way tables of frequencies with chi-square and residuals

<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^tabchi^ displays information derived from the r x c table for rowvar
and colvar. 
<p>
The display contains 
<p>
   row and column identifiers, 
   
   (by default) observed frequencies and expected frequencies on a null
   hypothesis of no association between the row and column variables, 
   
   and (if desired)
<p>
        raw residuals, observed - expected, 
    
        Pearson residuals, (observed - expected) / sqrt(expected),
    
        contributions to chi-square, (observed - expected)^^2 / expected
    
   and  adjusted residuals, Pearson residuals divided by an estimate of their 
        standard error.
<p>
The Pearson and likelihood-ratio chi-square statistics and their
P-values are also given.
<p>
^tabchii^ displays the same information derived from the r x c table
using the values specified; rows are separated by the backslash ^\^.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^replace^ indicates that the variables listed by the ^tabchii^ command
    are to be left as the current data in place of whatever data were
    there.
<p>
^raw^, ^pearson^, ^cont^ and ^adjust^ produce displays of raw residuals,
    Pearson residuals, contributions to chi-square and adjusted
    residuals respectively.
<p>
^noo^, ^noe^ suppress display of observed and expected frequencies.
    These options may be useful when the focus is on residuals. ^noo^
    and ^noe^ without at least one of ^raw^, ^pearson^, ^cont^ and ^adjust^
    suppress the tabular display.
<p>
tabdisp_options are options of ^tabdisp^ other than ^cellvar( )^, which
    may be used to tune the tabular display.

^tabchi^ and ^tabchii^ leave behind appropriate rclass results produced by 
^tabulate^.
