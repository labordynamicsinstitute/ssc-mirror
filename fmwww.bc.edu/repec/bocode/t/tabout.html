                <i>N count mean median var sd skewness kurtosis uwsum</i>
                <i>sum min max p1 p5 p10 p25 p50 p75 p90 p95 p99 iqr</i>

<p>
            Note that you may enter the median as either <i>p50</i> or <i>median</i> and
            you may enter N as either <i>N</i> or <i>count</i>.
<p>
            When the<b> svy</b> option is used, you can also specify any of the
            following:<i>  se ci lb ub</i>
<p>
        <b>fweights aweights iweights</b> and<b> pweights</b> are allowed with<b> tabout</b>,
        depending on the underlying command; see Manual: <b>[U] 14.1.6 weight</b>
        and individual entries for<b> [R] tabulate</b> and<b> [R] summarize</b>. For tables
        of summary statistics, <b>iweight</b>s are not allowed, because <b>tabout</b> uses
        the <b>detail</b> option in <i>Stata</i>'s summarize command (which does not allow
        <b>iweight</b>s). The<b> svy</b> option requires that the data be already<b> svyset</b>
        and an error message reminds you of this if you forget.
<p>
        Note that<b> tabout</b> will work under Stata 9.2 onward. An older version
        of <b>tabout</b> (which works with Stata 8.2) called <b>tabout8</b> is available
        here: http://www.ianwatson.com.au/stata/tabout8.ado.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>tabout</b> is a table building program for oneway and twoway tables of
    frequencies and percentages, and for summary tables. It produces
    publication quality tables for export to a text file. These tables can
    then be used with spreadsheets, word processors, web browsers or
    compilers like LaTeX. The tables produced by <b>tabout</b> allow multiple panels
    so that a number of variables can be included in the one table. <b>tabout</b>
    also provides standard errors and confidence intervals, as well as a
    range of table statistics (chi2 etc). The output from <b>tabout</b> matches
    <i>Stata's</i><b> tabulate</b>, most of<b> tabstat</b> and some of<b> table</b>.
<p>
    <b>tabout</b> has a comprehensive tutorial which includes numerous examples.
    This is available from the SSC with this help file. The tutorial is also
    available here: http://www.ianwatson.com.au/stata/tabout_tutorial.pdf.

<p>
    <b>using</b> is required, and indicates the filename for the output. Some
        applications (particularly MS Excel) "lock" files when they're open.
        <b>tabout</b> cannot write to these files and consequently issues an error
        message, warning you to check if the file is already open in another
        application.
<p>
    <b>replace</b> and<b> append</b> are file options, and determine whether the current
        output will overwrite an existing file, or be appended to the end of
        that file. If you omit<b> append</b> or<b> replace</b>,<b> tabout</b> issues a warning if
        the file already exists.
<p>
    <b>cells</b> determines the contents of table cells. As the table below shows,
        you can enter any one or more of<i> freq cell row col cum</i> in a basic
        table.  They can be in any order. When you choose the<b> svy</b> option, you
        can only have one of these choices, and it must come first.  The
        additional choices which are then available are:<i>  se ci lb ub</i>.
<p>
        For summary tables, you can have any of the<i> contents</i> listed earlier.
        If you are creating a twoway table, only one summary statistic may go
        in a cell (eg.<i>  median wage</i>); if it's a oneway table, any number of
        statistics (followed by a variable name) may go in the cell (eg.
        <i>median wage mean age iqr weight</i>). When you choose the<b> svy</b> option with
        summary tables, only <i>mean</i> is allowed (eg.<b>  mean wage se ci</b>.)

    <b>format</b> indicates the number of decimal points. Unlike mainstream <i>Stata</i>,
        this option only requires a number. Do not enter % or f symbols. You
        can however, enter<b> c</b> for comma,<b> p</b> for percentage, and<b> m</b> for money
        (currency) and you can use the<b> money</b> option (see below) to specify
        the currency. For example, you might enter<b> f(0c 1p 1p 2)</b> to produce:
        1,291 9.2% 10.3% 23.93. The entries should be in the same order as
        the<b> cells</b> order, that is, if<b> freq</b> comes first, then<b> 0c</b> should come
        first if you want 0 decimal points (with commas) as the format for
        frequencies. You do not have to type in the same number of format
        entries as there are cell entries. If you include more,<b> tabout</b>
        ignores them; if you include less, the last<b> format</b> entry is repeated
        for the remaining cell entries.
<p>
    <b>clab</b> determines the column headings for the third row of the table, that
        is, the headings just above the data. By default,<b> tabout</b> places the
        horizontal variable's name in the first row, its value labels in the
        second row, and an abbreviation for the cell contents (eg. No. Row %
        etc) in the third row. You can over-ride all of these defaults using
        the<b> h1 h2</b> and<b> h3</b> options (see below). Most of the time, however, it
        will only be the third row which you need to change, so the<b> clab</b>
        option makes this easy for you.  Just enter the column titles as you
        want them to display, without quote marks or other symbols. <i>However</i>,
        you must include underscores between words if there are spaces in the
        column title, for example<b> clab(No. Row_% Col_%)</b>. You do not have to
        type in the same number of<b> clab</b> entries as there are cell entries. If
        you include more,<b> tabout</b> ignores them; if you include less, the last
        <b>clab</b> entry is repeated for the remaining cell entries. For example if
        your cell entry was<b> freq col row cum</b> you could just enter<b> clab(No.</b>
        <b>%)</b>and all but the first column of data would have % symbols at the
        top.
<p>
    <b>layout</b> determines how the columns will be laid out. They can be in
        alternating columns (No. % No. % No. %) and alternating rows (No. on
        the first row, % on the next two, then back to No. and so on). They
        can be in column blocks, or in row blocks, where the data is kept
        contiguous, for example: No. No. No. % % %. The exception to this is
        summary tables where the layout is fixed and you have no choice.
        (However, an exception to this is the<b> svy</b> option, which can be laid
        out using all of these options. See the earlier table for
        clarification.)
<p>
    <b>oneway</b> tells<b> tabout</b> that the list of variables are all vertical.
        Normally,<b> tabout</b> assumes that the last variable in the list is the
        horizontal variable, to be used in a twoway cross-tabulation. To
        override this default behaviour, specify<b> oneway</b>.
<p>
    <b>sum</b> tells<b> tabout</b> that the table is to be a summary table.  Normally,
        <b>tabout</b> assumes that the table will be a basic table and checks to see
        if the<b> cells</b> contents have the correct entries (<b> freq row col</b> etc).
        By telling<b> tabout</b> that the table is a summary table, this checking
        process includes checks for the various summary statistics and the
        variables in the data set. The<b> sum</b> option is essential if you wish to
        produce a summary table.
<p>
    <b>stats</b> allows you to include additional information based on the various
        statistics available in<b> tabulate</b>.  Note that, unlike<b> tabulate</b>,<b> tabout</b>
        requires that you enter the full term (and not an abbreviation) and
        will only allow <i>one</i> statistic in a table. You must enter<b> chi2</b>, not
        just<b> chi</b>.
<p>
<a name="sam"></a><p>
        +-------------------------+
    ----+ sample size (n) options +------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>npos</b> determines where the n information will be place. The various n
        options (<b> npos nlab nwt nnoc</b>) provide sample counts for the table.
        You need only enter one of these options for the n to be included.
        For the options you have not entered,<b> tabout</b> places make use of the
        default values.
<p>
    <b>lab</b> determines the label for the n counts. The default for<b> col</b> and<b> row</b>
        positions is a simple uppercase N; for the<b> lab</b> position it is<b> (n=#)</b>
        where # stands for number; and for the<b> tufte</b> position it is<b> (#%)</b>. You
        can change all of these except the<b> tufte</b> position (which is fixed),
        and if you wish to alter the<b> lab</b> position, use the # symbol to
        indicate where the number should go. For example, {cmd: npos(lab)
        nlab(Sample count=#)}.  The<b> npos(tufte)</b> option provides a convenient
        way of displaying a percentage breakdown, rather than a count, for
        the main vertical variables. The name comes from the approach adopted
        by Edward Tufte in his construction of a supertable, which he
        designed for the <i>New York Times</i> in 1980.
<p>
    <b>nwt</b> indicates that the n count be weighted by this variable. This can be
        useful for producing population estimates in a table, rather than
        just sample counts. Note that<b> tabout</b> always uses <i>Stata</i>'s<b> iweight</b>
        option for this weighting.
<p>
    <b>nnoc</b> stands for n-no-comma and turns off the comma in the n count.
        Because<b> tabout</b> does not provide a<b> format</b> option for n counts (decimal
        points don't really make sense here), the default behaviour is to
        include commas. The<b> nnoc</b> option over-rides this default behaviour.
<p>
    <b>noffset</b>stands for n offset and determines where the n counts should be
        placed. The default is 1, which means the n counts will be in the
        first data column and/or the first data row in a table.  Setting
        <b>noff(2)</b> for example, allows you to shift the n counts further along
        (or down) in the table, into either the second data column or the
        second data row. If you are using block layouts (<b>layout(cb)</b> or
        <b>layout(rb)</b>), the<b> noffset</b> option applies to blocks rather than
        individual columns or rows.
<p>
<a name="sur"></a><p>
        +----------------+
    ----+ survey options +---------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>svy</b> tells<b> tabout</b> that the<b> cell</b> contents include survey output, and so the
        checking procedure (mentioned earlier) looks for things like<b> se</b>,<b> ci</b>
        and so forth. You must turn on<b> svy</b> is you wish to include survey
        output in your table.
<p>
    <b>sebnone</b> stands for se-brackets-none and tells<b> tabout</b> to suppress the
        parentheses which normally surround the standard errors.
<p>
    <b>cibnone</b> stands for ci-brackets-none and tells<b> tabout</b> to suppress the
        square brackets which normally surround the confidence intervals.
<p>
    <b>cisep</b> stands for ci-separator and tells<b> tabout</b> to replace the default
        (which is a comma) by whatever the user enters (for example, a dash).
<p>
    <b>ci2col</b> stands for ci-in-two-columns and tells<b> tabout</b> to place the<b> lb</b> and
        <b>ub</b> estimates in two columns (as it normally does), and to place a [
        and a , in the first column, and a ] in the second column.  This can
        be useful for layout in a word processor, because the first column
        can be right aligned (to the comma) and the second column can be left
        aligned, and it appears that you have a single column for your ci,
        which is neatly aligned according to the commas. Note that if you
        select<b> ci</b> in the<b> cells</b>,<b> tabout</b> normally places both the lower bound
        and the upper bound in a single cell and includes brackets and
        separator. The<b> ci2col</b> does not apply in this case. For it to work,
        you need to specify the upper and lower bound options, for example:
        {cmd: cell(freq lb ub) ci2col}.
<p>
    <b>percent</b> tells<b> tabout</b> that the<b> svy</b> output should be shown as percentages,
        not proportions. This follows the default behaviour of<b> svy:tab</b>.
<p>
    <b>level</b> specifies the level for the<b> svy</b> estimates. The default is 95%.
<p>
    <b>pop</b> specifies that a weighted population estimate should be provided for
        the n in the table, rather than the sample size. This option makes
        use of the weight specified by the<b> nwt</b> option. This makes the<b> svy</b>
        option work the same as the<b> nwt</b> option with non-survey tables.
<p>
<a name="tot"></a><p>
        +---------------+
    ----+ total options +----------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>total</b> tells<b> tabout</b> what labels to use for totals. The vertical total
        comes first, the horizontal second. The default labels for these
        variables are<i> Total</i>. If there are spaces in either of the labels
        which you wish to enter, use underscores. For example,
        <i>total(All_persons Total)</i>.
<p>
    <b>ptotal</b> tells<b> tabout</b> how to treat the totals for each panel, when you have
        multiple panels in a table. The default behaviour is to show all
        totals, but this can sometimes be repetitive, so you can specify
        <b>ptotal(single)</b> to have a single total row shown at the bottom of the
        table. You can also turn off all totals with<b> ptotal(none)</b>.
<p>
    <b>h1</b> through to<b> h3</b> over-ride the default headings for a table.  If you
        choose to use these, there are a couple of requirements. If you have
        selected either<b> tex</b> or<b> htm</b> as your output style, you are responsible
        for all the various code needed.<b>  tabout</b> does not make <i>any</i>
        adjustments to what you enter, it just outputs it as it finds it.  If
        you have chosen<b> tab</b> or<b> csv</b> as your output style, you must enter a
        delimiter to indicate where the columns are in your heading. Unlike
        the usual<b> tabout</b> practice, you do not need to worry about spaces in
        your titles (no need for underscores!) because this column delimiter
        takes care of things. However, the number of delimiters must match
        the number of columns in the table or the headings may be out of
        alignment. You might enter:<b>  h2( | Very good | Good | Bad | Very bad</b>
        <b>| Total | N)</b> and the first column heading would be empty, and the
        remaining columns would have the appropriate labels. Note that the
        <b>npos(col)</b> option usually places the<b> nlab</b> on the<b> h2</b> line so you may
        need to include this yourself in your<b> h2</b> label, as in the example
        just given. To suppress the display of any of these headings, enter
        `nil' into the appropriate option (for example,<b> h3(nil)</b>).
<p>
<a name="sty"></a><p>
        +---------------+
    ----+ style options +----------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>style</b> The default is<b> style(tab)</b>, which is useful for importing into
        spreadsheets or word processors. Note that the first row always has
        the correct number of tabs, even when a single title is involved.
        This helps other applications parse the table correctly. Note also
        that the repetition of labels in headings can be easily dealt with by
        using a merge cells command in your spreadsheet or word processor.
        The<b> style(csv)</b> option is useful for importing into spreadsheets (like
        MS Excel) because it opens immediately as a spreadsheet. The
        <b>style(semi)</b> uses semi-colons as the delimiter.  Note, however, that
        some spreadsheets ignore trailing 0s, so this may muck up your neat
        formatting. To avoid this, export the table from<b> tabout</b> as<b> style(tab)</b>
        and use the wizard in your spreadsheet to indicate that all columns
        are text rather than general.
<p>
    <b>lines</b> indicates how much space (for<b> style(tab)</b> and<b> style(csv)</b>) or how
        many lines (for<b> style(tex)</b>) should separate tables between panels.
        The default is<b> single</b>.
<p>
    <b>font</b> only applies to<b> style(tex)</b> and<b> style(htm)</b> and provides bold and
        italic fonts for the vertical variable names and the horizontal
        variable names and value labels. The totals are also given this font.
        You can also use the<b> h1</b> to<b> h3</b> options to manually set up fonts for
        your titles.
<p>
    <b>bt</b> only applies to users of LaTeX, and requires that you have the
        <b>booktabs</b> package installed. This allows the use of the toprule,
        midrule and bottomrule commands, rather than the usual hline command.
        It produces more pleasing output.
<p>
    <b>rotate</b> only applies to users of LaTeX, and can be used to rotate the
        horizontal variable's labels through whatever angle is entered in
        this option. For example,<b> rotate(60)</b> produces quite a pleasing
        effect.
<p>
<p>
    <b>cl1</b> and<b> cl2</b> only apply to users of LaTeX, and also requires that you use
        the booktabs package in your LaTeX document. These options can be
        used to place column lines (hence cl) between the first and second
        heading rows, and between the second and third heading rows (hence
        two sets). You enter the column numbers which you wish to span,
        separated with a dash. For example, to place a line under the
        horizontal variable's name, you might enter:<b>  cl1(2-6)</b> in a table
        with six columns. If you are entering lines spanning blocks of
        columns (2-4 5-7), you might need to fine tune the gap between them
        using<b> cltr1</b> and<b> cltr2</b>. By default, whenever you specify either of the
        <b>cl</b> options,<b> tabout</b> places a small gap (0.75em) between adjacent
        lines.
<p>
    <b>cltr1</b> and<b> cltr2</b> stand for column-line-trim, and allow you to specify an
        amount of trim to be applied to the left side of the<b> cl1</b> or<b> cl2</b> lines
        which you have entered. You can specify the amount in whatever
        acceptable tex measurement you like. For example:<b>  cl2(2-3 4-5 6-7)</b>
        <b>cltr2(1.5em)</b>. As just noted, the default amount is 0.75em.
<p>
<a name="add"></a><p>
        +---------------------------+
    ----+ additional output options +----------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>body</b> is used to insert some basic html or LaTeX code above and below the
        table. This allows you to view the table without further coding.
<p>
    <b>topf</b> and<b> botf</b> allow you to insert code stored in files which<b> tabout</b> can
        insert above and below the tables. These are particularly useful for
        html and LaTeX users, and allow you to control the layout of the
        tables more precisely. All users will find them useful as a way of
        inserting additional information above and below the table, such as
        notes, populations, data sources (for the bottom of the table) and
        titles (for the top of the table).
<p>
    <b>topstr</b> and<b> botstr</b> contain text which you can pass to the<b> topf</b> and<b> botf</b>
        files. This text will be inserted into the files where ever the
        placeholder (default #) has been placed. Note that each placeholder
        must be on a separate line in these files. The strings designated in
        the<b> topstr</b> and<b> botstr</b> must be separated with the pipe delimiter (or
        other user-chosen delimiter) if there is more than one block of text
        being passed.
<p>
    <b>psymbol</b> stands for placeholder-symbol and can be any symbol the user
        chooses. The default is # and it provides a placeholder in the stored
        files (the<b> topf</b> and<b> botf</b>) which<b> tabout</b> places above and below the
        tables.
<p>
    <b>delimit</b> can be any symbol the user chooses. The default is the pipe
        delimiter (|) as shown in the earlier example. It is used to specify
        columns within the<b> h1</b> to<b> h3</b> options, and for separating the contents
        of the<b> topstr</b> and<b> botstr</b> options. Note, unlike earlier versions of
        <b>tabout</b>, the delimit symbol is no longer used for labels. Instead,
        underscores are used to close-up spaces and parsing is done on the
        remaining spaces.
<p>
<a name="mis"></a><p>
        +-----------------------+
    ----+ miscellaneous options +--------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>dpcomma</b> specifies that<b> tabout</b> should use commas for decimal points and
        periods (full-stops) for thousand separators. This style is common in
        many European countries. This option affects the presentation of both
        the tabular output and the statistics when these are requested (such
        as chi2).
<p>
    <b>money</b> indicates the currency to be used if you have chosen the money
        format. For example,<b> format(2m) money(\pounds)</b>. You can enter any
        symbol that your keyboard allows. For LaTeX users, you can enter any
        text which LaTeX accepts, though you may need to include quotes.
<p>
    <b>mi</b> specifies that tabout should display missing values. This works the
        same as the mi option in Stata's tabulate command.
<p>
    <b>sort</b> specifies that tabout should display values in descending order of
        frequecy.  This works the same as the sort option in Stata's tabulate
        oneway command. Note that you cannot use this option with twoway
        tables.
<p>
    <b>chkwtnone</b> prevents <b>tabout</b> from checking the legality of your weights.
        <b>Stata</b> commands will not allow you to use non-integer frequency
        weights and <b>tabout</b> normally checks for this. You can over-ride this
        behaviour with the <b>chkwtnone</b> option. Note that this option does not
        stop <b>Stata</b> itself from refusing to use non-integer frequency weights.
<p>
    <b>debug</b> shows you most of the underlying <i>Stata</i> commands (though not for
        summary tables) from which the tables are built. This can be useful
        for confirming your results.
<p>
    <b>noborder</b> only applies to html output, and determines whether the table
        and cells should be surrounded by borders. This only applies when the
        <b>body</b> option is turned on.
<p>
    <b>show</b> determines what will be seen on the screen. The<b> show(all)</b> option
        displays the final table output as well as the Mata string matrices
        which are used to build this final output. The contents of these
        matrices may not exactly match the final output, in terms of
        formatting and labelling. The<b> show(none)</b> option suppresses all output
        except for the name of the file to which the table has been exported.
        The default option is to show the output which has been sent to a
        file. It may look messy on the screen, but open it in the appropriate
        application to check it first before panicking.
<p>
    <b>wide</b> is used in conjunction with<b> show(all)</b> and specifies the width of the
        columns in the Mata matrices. The default is 10 spaces. Note that
        even if you reduce this to a very small number,<b> tabout</b> will always
        increase the width of the columns to accommodate the widest cell
        entry in the data.

<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    The best examples are to be found in the tutorial (
    http://www.ianwatson.com.au/stata/tabout_tutorial.pdf) where both the
    syntax and the final table can be viewed, side by side. The following
    examples illustrate each of the types of table outlined earlier.  The
    datasets used in the following examples are all built-in Stata datasets,
    namely, nlsw88.dta and voter.dta.
