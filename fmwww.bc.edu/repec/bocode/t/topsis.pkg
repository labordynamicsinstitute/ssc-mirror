d 'TOPSIS': module to calculate comprehensive scores based on the entropy method or the entropy-TOPSIS method
d
d      topsis is used to calculate comprehensive scores based on
d the entropy method or the TOPSIS method.    This command allows
d users to specify both positive and negative indicators, and
d automatically performs data normalization, calculates information
d entropy, redundancy,	  and weights, and finally calculates a
d comprehensive score.	  Additionally, the program can use the
d TOPSIS method to calculate the score (optional, depending on user
d preference).	  If the topsis option is not used, the program
d will output the information entropy, redundancy, and weights of
d each indicator, and by default, display the	 comprehensive
d scores for the first 10 samples.
