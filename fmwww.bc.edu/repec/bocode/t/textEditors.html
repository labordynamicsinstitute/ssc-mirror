This FAQ is intended primarily for users of the statistical software 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>. Frequently there are questions on 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/res/statalist.html">Statalist</a>
seeking advice on text editors to use with Stata. We believe that most if not
all Stata users would find a good text editor very helpful for working with
<b>do</b> or <b>ado</b> files, <b>log</b> files, text data files and any
other text files they may be using. Indeed, many users already have some
favorite editor(s) which they employ alongside Stata.

<p> 
If this web page is of any interest to people who are not Stata users,
that's fine. But please note that we have no desire to develop this page into a
completely general guide to text editors. One fine source of information 
is Wikipedia. See for example the list of articles at

<h3><a name="disclaim">Limitations &#150; and a disclaimer</a></h3>

<p> 
Just a brief search of the internet or of available documentation will reveal
many possible editors, even for one of the platforms, Macintosh, various
flavors of Unix (including Linux) and Windows, on which Stata runs. All we do
here is provide some general comments and some specific comments based on our
experiences. We are not shy about recommending editors enthusiastically which
we have found reliable, versatile and productive. Conversely, it would be
futile to make comments on editors we know little or nothing about. If a
particular text editor is not mentioned here, by far the most likely reason is
that we don't use it, not that it has no value. Nor is the amount of coverage
necessarily a measure of the value of an editor, and we welcome suggestions and
corrections from those with expertise and experience in the use of particular
editors together with Stata. Finally, it should be obvious, but let us
underscore that what follows is often just personal opinion, and is not to be
attributed to any institution, either those we work for or those we don't. ("I"
within any section refers to the person named as its author.) 

<h3><a name="nowp">Don't use a word processor to edit text files</a></h3> 

<p>
First, be clear about the difference between a word processor and a text
editor. A <b>word processor</b> (for many Stata users, the example to spring to
mind will be MS Word) formats and organises a document. Everything about how a
word processor works is aimed at this: styling text, integrating tables and
figures, creating footnotes and indexes, and so on. A <b>text editor</b> by
contrast is predisposed to treat a pure text file quite literally.  In a text
file lines of text are the fundamental units and, very often, should be
maintained as is in order that data and programs can be understood correctly by
whatever software reads them &#150; and, indeed, by the people who read them. 

<p> 
Word processors insert line breaks and page breaks to make the document follow
a uniform style.  They frequently have automatic features such as substituting
curly quotes for those you actually typed. Word processors can save files as
plain text, but they have an overwhelming bias to producing documents in some
proprietary format (such as <b>.doc</b>). Even if you attempt to save a file as
plain text, the results can be unpredictable, and, most crucially, when working
with pure text files in a word processor it is easy to forget to do this, and
the resulting file can thus be messed up. 

<p> 
Moreover, while a word processor may be heavily laden with features, many
of those features are irrelevant to, or even a hindrance to, efficient text
file editing, and the features most needed for text editing may be hard to
find, or even absent. In addition, it is often true that word processors are not
fast enough to handle even moderately large text files comfortably.
For example, when opening text files you have to wait while the software translates
between text format and its own native format. 

<p>
Let us single out some of the specific advantages of text editors.

<p><b>Ability to work with large text files</b> One major advantage of a text
editor for many statistical researchers is the ability to work with quite
sizable text files such as the machine-readable ASCII codebooks provided with
many survey data sets.  An efficient text editor will usually be able to search
such a document much more quickly than a word processor, and will display the
material in a fixed-width font, preserving the alignment of original card-image
records.

<p><b>Support for multi-platform files</b> Text files created on the
three major platforms (Macintosh, Unix/Linux and Windows) differ in the way
lines are terminated, with Mac OS using a carriage return, Unix/Linux using
a linefeed, and Windows using both.  Stata is smart enough to work
with all three formats transparently: however, some word processors
(most notably MS Word) are not.  A good text editor will work with all
three formats, and permit you to save files in all three.
</p>

<p><b>Support for regular expressions</b> Good text editors have sophisticated
capabilities for the handling of so-called regular expressions. 
For example, your word processor will allow you to search a file for a specific word or
phrase, and replace it with another specific word or phrase.  However, suppose
that you wanted to find and delete all of the lines in a file that did not
begin with isolated periods, as would be required to turn a Stata <b>log</b>
file into a <b>do</b> file. Or suppose you wanted to look for all occurrences
of <b>regress</b>, <b>reg</b>, or anything in between. These tasks and others
like them require the ability to search for (and replace) general patterns of
characters, rather than just one particular instance of a pattern, and this
capability is provided by many text editors (and also by utilities such as <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/grep.html">grep</a>, <a
href="http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/">sed</a>, and <a
href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-lang/awk/faq/">awk</a>).  Such patterns
are specified using a "regular expression": a simple web search for "regular
expressions" yields several pages devoted to explaining them in detail, 
such as <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/helpsheets/regex.html">
http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/helpsheets/regex.html</a>. 
In addition, most books on scripting languages such as Perl, Tcl, and Python have
sections devoted to regular expressions, as such languages make extensive use
of them. It is difficult to convey in only a few sentences how powerful the
ability to work with regular expressions can be, but suffice it to say that
many problems that arise in manipulating raw data so that they may be read
easily into Stata can be quickly solved with a text editor equipped with
regular expression matching.

<p>See also an excellent page on regular expressions in Stata itself: 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/data/regex.html">
What are regular expressions and how can I use them in Stata?
</a> 
 
<p><b>Support for operations across multiple files</b> 
In essence, word processors are designed to edit only one file at a time.
Thus, if you have 10 <b>do</b> files each containing a reference to the path
"/u2/here" which you want to change to "/u3/there", you need to edit the files
one after another.  In contrast, many text editors will permit you to work with
multiple files simultaneously, thus allowing you to make the change in all
files through one action.  Another feature that is useful when working with
multiple files is the ability to identify and to browse through the differences
between two or more files, and to patch differences between them.  This can be
invaluable when you want to know if (and how) two raw data files differ, or
when you want to see where an updated <b>do</b> or <b>ado</b> file has been
revised.

<p><b>Extensibility</b> In addition to the features described above, some text
editors allow users to modify and to extend their built-in functionality by
writing their own editing functions using a standard language (e.g., Lisp, Tcl, 
Python) or the editor's own language. This is similar to what one can accomplish using
macros and/or Visual Basic in MS Word, but with a much greater level of
flexibility and access to the operating system, and in a way that is easier to
generalize for use on different platforms.
 
<p>
In short, we urge strongly that you <b>don't use a word processor to edit
text files, such as data or program files</b>. Negatively, even if you manage
to do it, it takes much longer, and the chance of mistakes is much higher.
Positively, good text editors have many features specifically useful for such
files.
 
<h3><a name="want">Choosing a text editor</a></h3> 
 
<p>
Stata users will naturally be doing other things on computers apart from using
Stata, and in some cases their use of Stata will be only a small fraction of
their computer time. Which text editors might be a good choice for you will
depend not only on the ways in which you use Stata, but also on what else you 
do, on the platform you use (Macintosh, Unix/Linux, Windows), and on your
personal tastes. Talk to people who work in your area, preferably near enough 
to phone for advice, and see what they use. Best of all, you will be well
advised to ask some local expert who can give guidance, particularly if that
expert is skilled with a particular editor and is willing to help out a bit as
you climb the learning curve. 

<p>
Broadly speaking, the importance of a text editor to you as Stata user will
depend on how many of the following kinds of file you will produce, look at or
change: 

<ul> 
<li>text data files 
<li><b>log</b> files 
<li><b>do</b> files
<li><b>ado</b> files (programs)
</ul> 

<p>
Although Stata's data management facilities are excellent, it is often the case
that questions about text data files are best handled upstream by looking at
them in a text editor. (In passing, however, we draw attention to the excellent
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?hexdump">hexdump</a> command added in 
Stata 7, which is invaluable for identifying some kinds of problems in data
files: it can even be useful for looking inside binary files.) Similarly, some
editing of a <b>log</b> file may be easier in a text
editor than in a word processor.  Finally, if you are working with <b>do</b>
files a lot, and especially with programs defined by <b>ado</b> files, then
features provided by good text editors such as syntax highlighting,
which is explained below, will be proportionately valuable to you.

<h3><a name="hh">Heiberger and Holland on text editors</a></h3>

<p>Richard M. Heiberger and Burt Holland have some detailed 
comments on text editors for statistical analysis in their 
<i>Statistical analysis and data display: An intermediate course with 
examples in  S-Plus, R, and SAS</i>, Springer, New York, 2004, 
Appendix E. They write (p.663): 

<blockquote>
`An excellent text editor is an indispensable tool for the statistical
analyst. The editor is the single program in which we spend most of our time.
We use it for looking at raw data, for writing commands in the statistical
languages we use, for reading the output tables produced by our statistical
programs, for writing reports, and for reading and writing correspondence about
our studies to our clients, consultants, supervisors, and subordinates.' 
</blockquote> 

<p>
They also suggest various requirements for any text editor to be 
used in interacting with a computing language (pp.663-4): 

<ol>
<li>Permit easy modification of computing instructions and facilitate their 
resubmission for processing
<li>Be able to operate on output as well as input
<li>Be able to cut, paste, and rearrange text; to search documents for 
strings of text; to work with rectangular regions of text
<li>Be aware of the language, for example, to illustrate the syntax 
with appropriate indentation and with color and font highlighting, 
to detect syntactic errors in input code, and to check the spelling 
of statistical keywords 
<li>Handle multiple files simultaneously 
<li>Interact cleanly with the presentation documents (reports and 
correspondence) based on the statistical results 
<li>Check spelling of words in natural languages
<li>Permit placement of graphics within text 
<li>Permit placement of mathematical expressions in the text. 
</ol>

<p>They recommend <b><a href="textEditors.html#emacs">Emacs</a></b> strongly. 

<h3><a name="doedit">Check out Stata's own Do-file Editor</a></h3> 

<p>
Within windowed versions of Stata, check out the Do-file Editor, which may be
opened by clicking on its icon or by typing the command 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?doedit">doedit</a>. This does not claim 
to be a full-featured text file editor, but we have found it very good for many
small to moderate tasks. The main documentation for <b>doedit</b> is in Stata's
<i>Getting Started</i> volume for each platform.

<p> 
The main advantage of <b>doedit</b> is full integration with the rest of Stata.
Being able to <a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?do">do</a> or 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?run">run</a> part of a <b>do</b> file is 
a notable feature. 

<p>
Take the time to learn about all the facilities in the Edit and Search menus,
such as "Balance", "Match", "Shift Left", "Shift Right", etc., which are
documented in the appropriate chapter of each <i>Getting Started</i> volume. 

<p> 
Note that the upper limit on files which can be read is 128K bytes 
(but Stata for Macintosh has no such limit). That's large
enough to handle a typical <b>do</b> or <b>ado</b> file a few thousand lines
long (and if yours are much longer, perhaps you should think of subdividing
them). 

<p>
Note also that under Windows the length of a filename cannot exceed 128 
characters, which is the limit imposed by the Microsoft call used. 
A work-around to fix this is on the StataCorp to do list.

<p>
In Stata for Macintosh and Stata for Windows, you can open
multiple Do-file Editors.

<p>
(Nicholas Winter and Hans J. Baumgartner:) There are some quirks in the Do-file
Editor's handling of fonts under Windows.  Size and font type can be selected
through the pull down menu (<b>Edit</b>, then <b>Preferences</b>); however,
characteristics such as bold and italic may not be set directly.  The <b>Edit, Preferences</b> menu can be
used to reset the face and size of the font, but not the bold or italic
characteristics. A work-around is to paste some non-bold, non-italic text into
the editor.  Note that all invisible paragraph marks in the window must be
pasted over, the easiest way being to select all text with <b>Ctrl-A</b> before
pasting. To set the new font characteristics as the default, you must save the
file being edited. (Before Stata 8.2, 
the editor took on the font attributes of text pasted into it. For example, if
text in Arial bold italic were pasted into the editor, then those formats would
override all default font settings. This is now fixed.) 

<p>(David Wagstaff:) In Stata before version 8, you can change 
the color of the font &#150; if working 
on Windows and with access to MS Word &#150; as follows. 
<ul> 
<li>Open MS Word, type text, and change the color of the font
to the desired color to be used in the Do-file editor. 
<li>Copy the text from Word and paste it into the Do-file
editor.  At this point, the editor should
display the text with the color used in Word. 
<li>Open another file with the Do-file editor.  It can be
an old file.  All of the text in the old file should
now display with the desired color. 
</ul> 

<p>(Note, however, that such a change in the Do-file 
editor is in a sense subverting its purpose.  It is intended to be a text 
editor, not a word processor. Given the way Windows works, users can 
change colors, or make text bold or italicized, but such details 
are between you and the operating system.)

<p>(H&#229;kon Finne, Ron&#225;n Conroy, Hans J. Baumgartner, Kit Baum:) You may want to install a 
font for the Do-file Editor that makes it easier to distinguish (e.g.) 0 (zero) from O
(upper case of o) and 1 (one) from l (lower case of L). Note that the Editor
accepts fixed-width TrueType fonts only. If you install a new font, it will 
appear in the <b>Edit, Preferences</b> menu. In particular, ProFont is free
and available for Macintosh or Windows. It is designed for programming, making 
most of the distinctions you need between confusable characters. Check out
<a href="http://www.tobiasjung.net/profont/index.html">
http://www.tobiasjung.net/profont/index.html</a>.

<p>Under Macintosh, 
<ul>
<li>Download ProFont distribution 2.2 for Mac. It is a StuffIt archive which
should automatically extract. If not, use StuffIt Expander to expand it.
<li>The TrueType font is in the folder called ProFont 2.2. There is also a
type 1 font in a folder called ATM Version. There is no reason to install
this.
<li>Install the font on Classic Mac OS versions up to 9.2.2 by dropping the
font on the system folder. The font will be recognised and put in the
fonts folder.
<li>Install on OS X by dragging the font to the fonts folder, which is in the
Library folder. To install for an individual user rather than all users of
the machine, drag the font to a <b>/Users/</b><i>username</i><b>/Library/Fonts</b>
folder.
</ul> 

<p>Under Windows, download the zip file, open it and drag 
the ProFontWindows.ttf file to the 
Windows Fonts directory, thus installing it.

<p>(Nicholas J. Cox:) User-written programs <b>adoedit</b> (Dan Blanchette) and
<b>fedit</b> (Nicholas J. Cox) are downloadable from <a
href="http://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html">SSC</a>.  In Stata, type (for
example) 

<b><pre>
. ssc desc adoedit
</pre></b> 

<p>for further information. The main idea of both is to use Stata's
<b>findfile</b> command to find a specified file along the user's
<b>adopath</b> and to open the Do-file editor on that file. In the case of
<b>fedit</b> users are encouraged to modify the program to call up a favorite
editor; in both cases users are discouraged from modifying any of Stata's
official files.

<h3><a name="integrate">Integrating Stata and an external editor</a></h3> 

<p>The alternative to using Stata's own do-file editor is to use an external
editor. While it is possible to invoke Stata and your chosen editor as entirely
separate applications, it is easy and beneficial to  set up closer integration
between them. There are different ways to do this: for example, to set up
calling of the editor from within Stata, or to run Stata from within your
editor. The next section discusses how to do this with AutoIt. 
Otherwise further details are given under each editor discussed in detail.

</p><h3><a name="autoit">Integrating Stata and external editors with AutoIt (Friedrich Huebler)</a></h3>

<p>The Do-file Editor of Stata has one advantage over external editors:
it is fully integrated with Stata and commands can be executed directly
from the editor, with a keyboard shortcut or the click of a button.
External editors often have a richer set of features, including syntax
highlighting, but they lack integration with Stata.  </p>

<p>This section shows how external text editors can be integrated with
Stata in a way similar to the Do-file Editor. This can be accomplished
with <a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/">AutoIt</a>, a free,
open source scripting language designed for automating tasks in Windows.
(AutoIt is not available for other platforms.) Two sample scripts are
available via <a
href="http://huebler.info/2005/20050310_Stata_editor.html">
http://huebler.info/2005/20050310_Stata_editor.html</a>,
which also gives detailed instructions. 
The first script runs an entire do-file from a text editor. The second
script runs selected lines from an editor.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements</span></p>

<p>Software needed:<br> </p>

<ul> 
<li>Stata version 7, 8, or 9. Older versions of Stata may also work
but have not been tested.</li> 
<li><a
href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/">AutoIt</a>. Download and
install it on your computer.</li> 
<li>Text editor. The sample scripts were
tested with <a target="_top" href="textEditors.html#emeditor">EmEditor</a> and <a target="_top"
href="textEditors.html#textpad">TextPad</a> but they should work with other editors
after minor modifications.</li> </ul>

The following steps describe how <b>AutoIt</b> scripts can be used to
integrate an external text editor with Stata.
<br>

<ol>
<li>Modify the scripts from <a
href="http://huebler.info/2005/20050310_Stata_editor.html">
http://huebler.info/2005/20050310_Stata_editor.html</a>, if
necessary, and save them as text files with the
extension AU3, for example as rundo.au3 and rundolines.au3.</li><li>Compile the scripts: There
are two ways to do this (see the AutoIt help file), either with the
"Compile script to .exe" program in the AutoIt v3 program group, or by
right-clicking on an .au3 file and selecting "Compile script" from the
context menu.</li>
<li>Find a way to call the
compiled scripts (in this example, rundo.exe and rundolines.exe) from
your text editor with a keyboard shortcut, a menu entry, or an icon in
the toolbar.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the case of <b>EmEditor</b>, the scripts can be called with the
External Tools feature. Go to the Tools menu and select External Tools
and then Customize Tools. Click on New and enter the information for the
first script: Title (e.g., "Run do-file"), Command (the full path to the
compiled script), and Icon Path (e.g., the path to the Stata executable,
but any other icon can be used).  Click on OK and again OK.  Go to the
Tools menu and select Customize Toolbars.  Select the desired toolbar
and click on Customize. Add the new icon to the toolbar and click on
Close. Repeat the steps for the second script; select a different icon
so that the two scripts can be distinguished easily. To call a script
click on one of the two new icons in the <b>EmEditor</b> toolbar.</p>

<p>With <b>TextPad</b> the scripts can also be called by adding them to
the toolbar. Go to Configure, Preferences, Tools, click Add, and browse
to the compiled AutoIt script. Then right-click on the toolbar, select
Customize, Commands, add an icon for the script, and move the icon to
the <b>TextPad</b> toolbar.</p>

<h3><a name="menu">Adding an editor to your menu system</a></h3>

<p>(David Wagstaff) Below is the code for my editors.ado, which
illustrates how I can call either of two separate editors. I run Stata 9
on a Windows XP machine that is connected to a 19-inch monitor.  With it, I can
have my Stata windows opened and still have access to the shortcuts for
my editors.  

<b><pre>
program define editors
	version 8
	window menu append submenu "stUser" "Editors"
	window menu append item "Editors" "EditPad" "winexec e:\tools\editors\editpad.exe"
	window menu append item "Editors" "UltraEdit" "winexec d:\progra~1\UltraEdit\uedit32.exe"
end
</pre></b> 

<p>(Jens M. Lauritsen) Edit the contents of your <b>profile.do</b> 
to include a line like 

<b>
<pre>
qui window menu append string "Edit" "&P Pfe" "winexec \program files\pfe\pfe32.exe"
</pre>
</b>

<p>or in Stata 8 

<b><pre>
qui window menu append item "stUser" "&P Pfe" "winexec \program files\pfe\pfe32.exe"
</pre></b> 

<p>This example would add the Windows editor <a href="textEditors.html#pfe">PFE</a>, which I use,
to the menu of Stata. Naturally, change the details given your own 
editor and its location on your system.

<p>With Stata 8 and Macintosh OS X, <b>winexec</b> is available 
with a limitation. The limitation is that only Mach-O native applications 
may be launched this way, not CFM applications.  How you can tell the
difference?  From an OS X command line such as one you would find while running
the Terminal application, type (for example)

<b><pre>
file /Applications/Stata/StataSE
</pre></b> 

<p> 
If it responds "Mach-O executable PPC", you can launch it using <b>winexec</b>.
If instead it responds "PEF binary", it is a CFM application and may not be
launched by <b>winexec</b>.

<p>Consider the TextEdit application located in the
<b>/Applications</b> directory.  If from the Terminal you type

<b><pre>
file /Applications/TextEdit
</pre></b> 

<p>you'll get the response "/Applications/TextEdit: can't stat
`/Applications/TextEdit' (No such file or directory)". 
That's because the TextEdit application is what's known as a "bundle" in OS X
lingo.  Even though you see the application TextEdit from the Finder, it is
really a directory called <b>TextEdit.app</b> that contains a bunch of files that
make up the application.  The actual executable is buried somewhere in there.
As it happens, it is in <b>/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/</b> &#150; 
so to launch TextEdit from Stata, you would type

<b><pre>
. winexec /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit
</pre></b> 

<p>So what you want to add to your <b>profile.do</b> is 

<b><pre>
qui window menu append item "stUser" "TextEdit" "winexec /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit"
</pre></b> 

<p>
Incidentally, Stata 8 is a bundle, so it is possible to launch another 
instance of Stata by specifying the path of the executable

<b><pre>
. winexec /Applications/Stata/StataSE.app/Contents/MacOS/StataSE
</pre></b> 

<p>
Don't forget that Stata will take command line arguments (see <a href="http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/mac/advanced8.html#startup">
http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/mac/advanced8.html#startup</a>).

<p>
You can also pass arguments to applications launched by <b>winexec</b> (assuming
they will accept them).  For example,

<b><pre>
. winexec /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /Users/someuser/myfile.do
</pre></b> 

<p>will launch TextEdit and open the file <b>myfile.do</b>.
However, you must specify the absolute path to the file:  Stata can not resolve
the path for you, because it has no idea that the argument you are trying to pass is
a path.  

<h3><a name="syntax">Syntax highlighting</a></h3> 

<p>
Details differ, but the main idea of syntax highlighting is that different
elements of the syntax of a language are colored in your text window(s) in
different ways. For this to work, someone has to write a specification of the
syntax, such as Stata syntax, in a form intelligible to the editor. Even an
imperfect specification can be a great help in aiding your editing: for
example, apparent mistakes may be coded distinctly, which helps you to spot
unmatched quotation marks, braces, square brackets and parentheses. 
Additionally, or alternatively, in some varieties of syntax highlighting 
a list of Stata command names is used to identify command calls. 
If an editor offers syntax highlighting for one language, then it probably offers
highlighting for many more, unless it is the editor part of some development
environment built around the interpreter or compiler for a specific programming
language. This can be useful also to people editing web documents: some prefer
to use a general text editor for editing (say) HTML documents, rather than
dedicated web software, if only because they find that they do not need extra
tools. 
 
<p> 
To our knowledge, some kind of syntax highlighting for Stata 
<b>do</b> or <b>ado</b> files is currently available for 
<b><a href="textEditors.html#alpha">Alpha</a></b>, <b><a href="textEditors.html#emacs">Emacs</a></b>, 
<b><a href="textEditors.html#jedit">jEdit</a></b>,

<b><a href="textEditors.html#ultraedit">UltraEdit</a></b>,
and 
<b><a href="textEditors.html#winedt">WinEdt</a></b>, 
as is explained in appropriate sections below.
Even if no Stata syntax highlighting is available in other editors, using (say)
C syntax highlighting if available is interesting and possibly even useful.

<h3><a name="cross">Cross-platform editors</a></h3>

<h4><a name="alpha">Alpha (Phil Schumm)</a></h4> 

<p><b>Alpha/Alphatk</b> is a shareware editor for the Macintosh, Unix/Linux 
or Windows. For download, 
see <a href="http://alphatcl.sourceforge.net/wikit/">
http://alphatcl.sourceforge.net/wikit/</a>. 
For other resources, see
<a href="http://magnet.fsu.edu/~hall/docscripting/alpha/">
http://magnet.fsu.edu/~hall/docscripting/alpha/</a>. 
<b>Alpha</b>
was originally written by Pete Keleher, but is now maintained by a group of
programmers referred to as the Alpha Cabal.

<p> 
<b>Alpha</b> is a powerful, multi-purpose editor originally written for the
Macintosh.  It is extensible through the use of the scripting language Tcl.  In
fact, the majority of <b>Alpha</b>'s core functionality is implemented directly
in Tcl, just as the majority of Stata's commands are implemented via <b>ado</b>
files distributed with the program.  As a result, users with even a modest
knowledge of Tcl can customize and extend <b>Alpha</b> to meet their specific
editing requirements.  Out of the box, <b>Alpha</b> includes editing modes for
more than three dozen different types of files, including several programming
and scripting languages, HTML files (highly acclaimed for this), LaTeX
files, PostScript files, and command files for several analytical and
statistical packages (e.g., Stata, S-PLUS/R, SAS, and MATLAB).

<p>Currently, there are two Stata modes available for <b>Alpha</b>.  One was
written by Craig Upright, and is distributed together with the <b>Alpha</b>
package.  A second mode was written by Phil Schumm, and is available by
contacting him at 
<a href="mailto:pschumm at uchicago.edu">pschumm at uchicago.edu</a>.  Both modes
provide the ability to execute <b>do</b> files (or a portion thereof) directly
from <b>Alpha</b>, and both provide features like automatic indenting and
matching of parentheses or brackets through use of <b>Alpha</b>'s own routines.
Craig's mode provides more elaborate syntax coloring and several special
routines for file marking and navigation.  In contrast, Phil's mode is
considerably more modest in what it attempts to do (e.g., only very limited
syntax coloring), but it has been used by Phil (and others) extensively.

<p> 
<b>Alphatk</b> is a version of <b>Alpha</b> written entirely in Tcl/Tk by Vince 
Darley.  <b>Alphatk</b> will (in principle) run on any platform on which Tcl/Tk can
be installed, and has been tested (and works nicely) on a variety of Unix/Linux
and Windows systems.  <b>Alpha</b> and <b>Alphatk</b> share the same set of Tcl code
files (known as <b>AlphaTcl</b>) that provide most of the editing functions, and
therefore the two editors are very close cousins.  In fact, one can move
easily between editing files on the Macintosh using <b>Alpha</b> and editing
files on a Unix/Linux or Windows machine using <b>Alphatk</b>.

<h4><a name="emacs">Emacs (Bill Rising, A.J. Rossini)</a></h4>

<p><b>Emacs</b> is a tremendously versatile, extensible text editor.
It provides tools and features for programming in many, many  
languages, as
well as tools for working easily in a distributed environment. It has
an extremely advanced Mail/News reader, remote file editing using  
ssh, scp,
telnet, rsh, WebDAV, and ftp protocols, class and object browsers for
programming, tree-views
for perusing directory structures, clean interfaces to
revision and version control systems such as RCS, CVS, SCCS, and
others, as well as calendars
and personal information managers (PIMs), and games.
In fact, one of its earlier application icons was a picture of a  
kitchen sink.
This versatility and maturity comes with one drawback: a steep  
learning curve.
However, if one is already familiar with other text editors such as  
<b>vi</b>
(and descendants) or <b>Brief</b>, <b>Emacs</b> comes with modes  
which remap command
key sequences to match those editors.
</p>

<p><b>Emacs</b> is open-source (it is free both as in free
beer and as in free speech), and can be run on almost any computer  
under almost
any operating system. There are now two flavors of <b>Emacs</b> being
developed on separate tracks by two groups,
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a> and the <a
href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs Project</a>.  Both groups provide
semi-compatible versions of <b>Emacs</b> for a large range of
operating systems and platforms: almost all Unix/Linux variants,
<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/ 
carbonemacspackage.html">Mac OS X</a> (as well as an older version <a  
href="http://mac-emacs.sourceforge.net/index.html">for
MacOS 9</a>), and almost all varieties of Microsoft Windows, as well.
<strong>XEmacs</strong> has an install-shield installer for Microsoft
Windows, and can be installed using the
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink MacOS X</a>
open source software installer on the Mac.


<p>(Ron&#225;n Conroy; David Reitter) Mac OS X users who don't
want to get used to Emacs' very distinctive interface might try the<a
href="http://aquamacs.org/"> Aquamacs Emacs</a>.
This distribution incorporates the behavior, look and layout of a
standard OS X application (including keyboard shortcuts),
in addition to the standard Emacs ones.
</p>


<p>There are two options for augmenting Emacs (or XEmacs) to play  
well with Stata:

<p><b>ado-mode</b> is an Emacs major mode (as extensions built to  
handle the
intricacies of languages are called in the Emacs world) made for editing
all types of Stata files intelligently.
It provides
<ul>
<li>context-sensitive highlighting of all Stata commands, some  
subcommmands,
local macros, keywords, defunct commands, and some of Stata 9's more  
complex constructions,</li>
<li>automatic indentation in a fashion that facilitates finding  
syntax errors,</li>
<li>parenthesis and quotation mark balancing (which is typical for  
Emacs)</li>
<li>automatic date and time stamping of files as they are saved  
(applies to help and ado files)</li>
<li>automatic name stamping of help files</li>
<li>use of directory paths to keep custom ado files well organized</li>
</ul>
Many of the features, such as indentation styles, can be easily  
customized via menus.
Template files are supplied which allow rapid writing help files in a  
style which matches Stata's own help files.
The <b>ado-mode</b> understands how to play well with <b>ado</b>,  
<b>do</b>, <b>hlp</b> and <b>smcl</b> files.
Note: <b>ado-mode</b> does <em>not</em> run under XEmacs, yet.
</p>
<p>See <a href="http://faculty.bellarmine.edu/wrising/Stata">
http://faculty.bellarmine.edu/wrising/Stata</a> for complete  
information and links for downloading.
</p>

<p><b>ESS</b>, <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/">
Emacs Speaks Statistics</a>, is another major mode for <b>Emacs</b>/ 
<b>XEmacs</b> which provides a
development environment for Stata, S (and relatives including S-PLUS  
and R),
SAS, and other statistical languages.  For every Stata platform, it  
provides an
editing mode with syntax highlighting (colorization and/or  
fontification) as
well as parenthesis or quotation mark balancing and highlighting of  
Stata
keywords.  For Stata under Unix/Linux, it also provides an execution  
environment
using the command-line version of Stata.
</p>

<p>The ESS execution environment provides keystrokes for sending lines,
regions, and buffers to the running Stata process for evaluation; it  
also
diverts output from help requests into their own buffers, both for  
ease in
look-up and to maintain a clean transcript of statistical activity. This
latter aspect of ESS works well with Stata 6.0: however, newer versions
do not support graphics when run from within Emacs.</p>

<p>One solution for this is to use ESS to communicate jointly with <a
href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> for producing nice graphics
while at the same time using Stata for its analysis facilities.  ESS
facilitates the use of a single file, formatted in LaTeX or HTML, for
combining code which can be sent to different processes (Stata or R)
for evaluation or produced into an HTML or LaTeX file for generating
documentation.  This approach, a take-off on D.E. Knuth's
<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">
"Literate Programming"</a>, is known as
<a href="http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/Conferences/DSC-2001/Proceedings/ 
Rossini.txt">
Literate Statistical Practice</a> (Rossini, 2001).
</p>

<p>Currently, ESS does not support Stata to the same extent that it
supports SAS and R.  This is primarily due to the power that it has
for handling I/O, and because recent versions of Stata (v7 and up)  
want to
control this as much as possible.
</p>

multipackage development environment for statistical analysis.
<i>Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics</i> 13, 247-261.

<p>
Here's the preferred decision chart for deciding on modes.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Use <b>ado-mode</b> for editing Stata ado files (in particular,
<b>definitely</b> for Stata 7 up).
</li>
<li>
When to think about ESS:
<ul>
<li> If you want interactive use with Stata 6 or earlier</li>
<li> If you are using XEmacs.  (XEmacs has
install-shield installers for Windows, and a package system that was
the prototype used for generating the <strong>R for Windows
point-and-click package installer</strong>, i.e. a point-and-click to
install Lisp packages.)  Unlike R's package installer, XEmacs' package
installer is available on all supported systems.</li>
<li>If you use SAS and R or S or S-PLUS as well (there are other  
minimally
supported languages, but those are the best).</li>
</ul>

<li>Both ESS and ado-mode are equally easy to install.</li>

<li>There was an older mode for editing Stata files by Thomas Lumley.
Since the most recent version is now incorporated in ESS, you should use
either ESS or ado-mode according to the recommendations above.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="jedit">jEdit (Glenn Hoetker)</a></h4> 

<p> 
<b>jEdit</b> is a free, Java-based editor aimed at the programmer, 
written by Slava Pestov and others.  Because it runs
on Java, it is identical on Windows, Mac OS X, and other Unix/Linux systems.
(It will not run under Classic Mac OS.) 
<b>jEdit</b> continues to be under active development, so eventually bugs are fixed
(I've not found any) and new features added. Having tried many text editors
with Stata, I'm now a firm fan of <b>jEdit</b>.  The price certainly couldn't be
better. It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.jedit.org/">http://www.jedit.org/</a>. 

<p> 
<p><b>jEdit</b> supports <b>syntax highlighting</b> for more than 70 file types.  
I've created a syntax file for Stata: 
<a href="http://www.business.uiuc.edu/ghoetker/documents/stata.xml">
http://www.business.uiuc.edu/ghoetker/documents/stata.xml</a>. You may copy 
that to your preferred location from within net-aware Stata: 

<b><pre>
copy http://www.business.uiuc.edu/ghoetker/documents/stata.xml <i>filename</i>
</pre></b>

<p> 
Unless you have changed the defaults of <b>jEdit</b>, you should download the 
file to the <b>modes</b> folder within the <b>jEdit</b> folder and leave it 
named <b>stata.xml</b>.  As noted in the file, you need to add the following 
text to the file <b>catalog</b> within the <b>modes</b> folder to have 
<b>jEdit</b> recognise Stata files: 

<b><pre>
&lt;MODE NAME="stata"              FILE="stata.xml"
                                FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.{do,ado,log}" /&gt;
</pre></b> 

<p> 
Here is a list of some of the many points that make it such a nice editor
for Stata (mostly lifted from the <b>jEdit</b> homepage, but edited to reflect 
my experience): 

<p>General: 
<ul> 
<li>Comprehensive online help
<li>Unlimited undo/redo
<li>Copy and paste with an unlimited number of clipboards (known as
"registers")
<li>Rich set of keyboard commands for manipulating entire words, lines and
paragraphs at a time
<li>"Markers" for remembering positions in files to return to later (saved
across editing sessions)
<li>Any number of editor windows may be open. Each window may be split into
several areas. Each area can view a different file. Alternatively, different
locations in one file can be viewed in more than one area
<li>Rectangular selection
<li>Multiple selection (sometimes known as "discontinuous" or "additive"
selection) for manipulating several chunks of text at once
</ul> 

<p>Code editing: 
<ul>
<li>Intelligent brackets/parentheses matching
<li>Auto indent
<li>Commands for shifting the indent left and right
<li>Commands for commenting out code, line by line or in large blocks.
<li>Add prefix/suffix command.  
Nice if you sometimes <b>#delimit</b> with semicolons and sometimes not.
</ul> 

<p>Search and replace: 
<ul>
<li> Both literal and regular expression search and replace supported
<li> Multiple file search and replace; search in the current file, all open
files, or all files in a directory
<li> "HyperSearch" option to show all found matches in a list
<li> Reverse search supported
<li> Incremental search supported
</ul> 

<p>File management: 
<ul> 
<li> Any number of files can be opened at once
<li> Files can be deleted and renamed, and new directories can be created from
the file system browser
</ul> 

<p>Customization: 
<ul> 
<li> Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts
<li> Fully customizable tool bar and right-click context menu
<li> Macros to automate complex editing tasks can be written in the BeanShell
scripting language
<li> Macros can be recorded from user actions
</ul> 

<p>Extensibility: 
<ul> 
<li> "Plugin manager" feature downloads and installs plugins from within <b>jEdit</b>
<li> More than 50 plugins are already available that add a variety of features
to <b>jEdit</b> (An example of a particularly useful plugin is
"Sessions", which allows you to save sets of related files as sessions
and switch between them with a single menu selection: so, you can close
and save all 5 files involved in project A and open up the 4 files
involved in project B quickly and automatically)  
</ul>

<p>(Ian Watson) Here are some additional comments on integrating <b>jEdit</b>
with Stata. Those running <b>jEdit</b> under Windows can also integrate Stata
more closely with <b>jEdit</b> when it comes to writing Stata code. The
following approach assumes that you have a Stata do-file inside <b>jEdit</b>
and wish to run selected portions of the file, examine the results in the Stata
output window, then return to your do-file for further editing. The sequence
suggested below makes use of the <b>F8</b> and <b>F9</b> keys, although any
other combination will work.

<p>This approach is based on two key ingredients:

<ul><li>using <b>jEdit</b>'s macro language to copy and paste the current
selection to a file (here called <b>marked.do</b>; other names are fine)

<li>using AutoIt scripts to facilitate switching between Stata and
<b>jEdit</b>.  </ul>

<p>Inside <b>jEdit</b>, the copying to <b>marked.do</b> macro is assigned to
<b>F9</b> and the switching to Stata macro is assigned to <b>F8</b>. Inside
Stata, <b>F9</b> is mapped to a command for running <b>marked.do</b>, and
<b>F8</b> is mapped to a command for switching back to <b>jEdit</b>. These keys
are easily remembered (<b>F9</b> is the code, <b>F8</b> does the switching) so
that the sequence <b>F9</b> <b>F8</b> <b>F9</b> <b>F8</b> becomes almost
automatic after a while.

<p> The macro for copying selected text to <b>marked.do</b> can be found at my
website, <a href="http://www.acirrt.com/watson/stata">
http://www.acirrt.com/watson/stata</a>, and can be saved under any file name you
like (but with the extension <b>.bsh</b>). You may need to edit the phrase
<b>new File("d:/data/marked.do")</b> to reflect your own directory
arrangements. Place the file in the macro directory of your <b>jEdit</b>
installation. (If you're not sure where it is, just record a macro and see
where <b>jEdit</b> wants to put it.) Then attach that macro to the <b>F9</b>
key using the <b>Utilities-Global Options-Shortcuts-Macros</b> menu. 

<p> The switching commands are done with AutoIt scripts. See 
<a href="textEditors.html#autoit">Integrating Stata and external editors with AutoIt</a>
for more details. The first script relevant to my discussion is

<b>
<pre>
Opt("SendKeyDelay", 1)
Opt("WinWaitDelay", 200)
WinActivate("Stata/SE 9.2")
</pre>
</b>

<p>
which should be saved as <b>switchtostata.au3</b> and then compiled to become
<b>switchtostata.exe</b>. (You need to make sure you have your correct version
of Stata (as shown in the title bar) in the last line.) 

<p>
The second script is

<b>
<pre>
Opt("SendKeyDelay", 1)
Opt("WinWaitDelay", 200)
WinActivate("jEdit")
</pre>
</b>

<p>
which should be saved as <b>switchtojedit.au3</b>
and then compiled to become <b>switchtojedit.exe</b>.

<p>
Getting these commands to run inside their respective applications is
straightforward.  At the <b>jEdit</b> end, just write a short macro:

<b>
<pre>
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("switchtostata");
</pre>
</b>

<p>
and save this as a macro file in the macro directory. Again, make sure the
filename has a <b>.bsh</b> extension, and then attach this to the <b>F8</b> key.

<p>
At the Stata end, both the <b>F8</b> and <b>F9</b> keys can be mapped to their
relevant commands by inserting the following code into your <b>profile.do</b>
file (located in Stata's root directory):

<b>
<pre>
global F8 "shell d:/data/switchtojedit;"
global F9 "do d:/data/marked;"
</pre>
</b>

<p>
To make sure everything works correctly, make sure both <b>jEdit</b> and Stata
can "see" the files they need to see. In my case, I've placed the AutoIt
executables in the <b>d:/data</b> directory, and I've also sent the selected
Stata code from <b>jEdit</b> to a file called <b>d:/data/marked.do</b>.  Modify these
paths, as necessary, to make things work on your machine. 

<p>
Finally, while these details assume a Windows installation, the same approach
can be taken with Macintosh and Unix/Linux installations. The copy to
<b>marked.do</b> macro does not need to be modified, but the AutoIt scripts
will need to be replaced by scripts appropriate to the relevant operating
system.

<h4><a name="slickedit">SlickEdit (John Kalat)</a></h4> 

<p><b>SlickEdit</b> is a text editor from SlickEdit, Inc. (Morrisville, NC)
which is available for Windows XP, 2000, NT, Me, and 98 and for Linux, Solaris,
AIX, HP-UX and IRIX.  The web address is 
<a href="http://www.slickedit.com/">http://www.slickedit.com/</a>. 

<p>I haven't found a file I could not load into <b>SlickEdit</b>, and we have
some large files (over 100 Mb).  Also, navigation through the file is fast.
You could pull the vertical bar to the top and bottom of the file with no
problem.  You could have a directory with 100 files in it, highlight all of
them, and press Enter.  They will all be opened in staggered, separate windows
in a few seconds.  If you have two files loaded, you can split the screen
horizontally or vertically to compare them.

<p>There is built-in emulation for CUA, Brief, Epsilon, vi, GNU Emacs, Visual
C++, ISPF and CodeWarrior.  There is syntax highlighting in everything from Ada
to XML, and also for Stata: see below.  <b>SlickEdit</b> has its own language
called Slick-C, but if you are not used to low-level languages, many things can
be accomplished through the menus. If you use the Windows Explorer, you can set
menu features so that double-clicking on files with extensions such as
<b>ado</b>, <b>do</b>, <b>txt</b> or <b>dat</b> will load those files into
<b>SlickEdit</b>.  All files you work on can be autosaved to a backup directory
so you don't lose any work.  There's a built-in calculator; you can shell out
to the operating system; you can compare two files for differences, run macros,
set key bindings, etc.
 
<p>Compared with the other editors described in this FAQ, it is expensive, but
if your organization wants you to be productive, and you can pick up one new
thing to do with the editor once a week, it is worth every penny.  I started
using <b>SlickEdit</b> about 1996 and now our organization owns several
dozen copies.

<p>To install <b>SlickEdit</b> on the Stata menu,  
edit the contents of your <b>profile.do</b> to include a line like 

<b>
<pre>
qui window menu append item "stUser" "SlickEdit" "winexec vs.exe"
</pre>
</b>

<h4><a name="vim">vim (Nicholas J. Cox)</a></h4> 

<p>
<b>vim</b> is an editor with a considerable pedigree. To simplify a complicated
history, involving several people: About 1970 Ken Thompson at Bell Labs wrote
the Unix line editor <b>ed</b>. This was developed at Berkeley into an extended
line editor <b>ex</b> in about 1976, and then into a screen plus line editor
<b>vi</b> in about 1978, principally by Bill Joy. (For some <i>pre</i>history, 
see Dennis Ritchie's notes on <b>QED</b> at  
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/qed.html">
http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/qed.html</a>.) 
 
<p>There are many clones of <b>vi</b> (which is pronounced as "vee-aye").
<b>vim</b> is by far the most popular, and the only one to be discussed here.
<b>vim 1.14</b> in 1991 was its first public release. Major features of
subsequent releases include support for multiple buffers and windows (3.0,
1994), a graphical user interface (4.0, 1996), syntax highlighting (5.0, 1998),
folding and vertical splitting (6.0, 2001) and too many highlights to choose
(7.0, 2006). 
 
<p> If you are on a Unix/Linux platform, then almost certainly all these editors will
be available to you: <b>vim</b> may often be available as <b>vi</b>. <b>vim</b>
has been ported to several platforms beyond Unix/Linux, including Macintosh and
Windows: see <a
href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/download.php">http://vim.sourceforge.net/download.php</a>.
I use <b>vim</b> on Windows, and have found it very stable. Once when Windows
crashed, I was able to retrieve the whole of a long editing session which I
foolishly had not written to file.
 
<p>
<b>vim</b> is <a
href="http://www.moolenaar.net/Charityware.html">charityware</a>.  Those who
appreciate it are asked to make a donation to a Ugandan charity supported by
<b>vim</b>'s maintainer, <a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/">Bram Moolenaar</a>.

<p>There is a website at <a href="http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org</a>, 
which leads to download sites. Many <b>vim</b> users have personal web pages on their 
favorite editor. 

<p>
<b>vim</b> is a combination of screen editor and line editor. You 
can see one or more portions of one or more files in one or more windows, and 
can insert, delete and change text more or less as you would in a word processor. 
In addition, you can change modes and issue commands, either in a text 
window or outside it. Switching between different modes can be tricky at first: 
it is only fair to say that some people find this aspect of <b>vim</b> 
offputting, but regular users find that knowing even a few commands imparts
both power and speed. Many <b>vim</b> commands are just a single character, and
can be combined with other parts of the syntax. As just a few examples,
<b>d$</b> deletes to end of line, <b>d)</b> to end of sentence, <b>d}</b> to
end of paragraph, <b>.</b> is repeat last change, and so on. Although
<b>vim</b> has an enormous number of commands, many users find that about a
hundred or so are sufficient for almost all their editing needs. 

<p> 
In addition, many of the keystrokes with standard interpretations in interacting with your
operating system retain meaning within <b>vim</b>. 
Windows users in particular should be reassured that much
can be done in ways familiar to them. For example, there is much emphasis in
most introductions on using the keys <b>h</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>k</b> and <b>l</b>
for moving left, down, up and right on the screen: because these keys are
placed centrally on keyboards, anyone who masters this is able to work very
efficiently.  However, in no sense is this compulsory, and those who like me
have long since internalised the use of cursor keys for these movements can
continue to use them. Similarly, rather more is possible with the mouse, and
even via menus, in GUI versions of <b>vim</b> than is clear from some
discussions. However, <b>vim</b> is no more a menu-driven program than is
Stata. If you really want a menu-driven editor, do look elsewhere. 

<p>
<b>vim</b> has the ability to do color syntax highlighting.  When used at
a Unix/Linux terminal, the colors are limited to those available for that
terminal. The GUI version of <b>vim</b> (<b>gvim</b>) does not have this
limitation. As of Vim 7.0 up, syntax files written by Jeff Pitblado of
StataCorp for Stata do-, ado-, class-, and smcl-files are included in 
the standard release. 

<!-- old stuff commented out 10 May 
The definitions required for <b>vim</b> to perform syntax
highlighting must be placed in a <b>vim</b> syntax file, which can then be
associated with file extensions.  One such syntax file may be downloaded
from <a href="http://www.stata.com/users/jpitblado/files/vimfiles/syntax/stata.vim">stata.vim</a>.

<p>Older Unix documentation remains not only of historical interest, 
but also of some use in giving good explanations of how the commands 
fit together. Although out of print, Berkeley Software Distribution, 
<i>4.4 BSD User's supplementary documents</i>, USENIX Association 
and O'Reilly, Sebastopol, CA, 1994, is one excellent collection which may be 
accessible to you. Failing that, various versions of manuals by 
Bill Joy and others may be found with a search engine. 

<p>
The following Stata programs are examples of how <b>vim</b> may be called
easily from within Stata to edit named files using 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?shell">shell</a> or 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?xshell">xshell</a> or 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?winexec">winexec</a>.  
(If the version of the editor you are using is called <b>vi</b>, then clearly you should use that name
instead.) For Unix/Linux (console) users,

<b>
<pre>
program vim 
	version 8 
	* discard 
	shell vim `*'
end
</pre>
</b> 

<p>
and for Unix/Linux (GUI) users,

<b>
<pre>
program vim 
	version 8 
	* discard 
	xshell vi `*'
end
</pre> 
</b> 

<p>
In Stata <b>!</b> is shorthand for <b>shell</b> and <b>!!</b> is 
shorthand for <b>xshell</b>.  Both of these
commands are blocking; Stata will wait for <b>vim</b> to exit before continuing.
Alternatively, Unix/Linux (GUI) users can use, for a non-blocking launch of 
<b>vim</b>, 

<b>
<pre>
program vim 
	version 8 
	* discard 
	winexec xterm -e vi `*'
end
</pre>
</b> 

<p>
Similarly, under Windows, I have found the following <b>ado</b> file useful 
for calling up <b>vim</b> to edit files from within Stata. 

<b>
<pre>
program vim
	version 8
	* discard
	winexec \vim\vim61\gvim.exe `*'
end
</pre>
</b>

<p>
(Note that the particular location of the executable on my machine is wired
into the last example code. The location on your machine is naturally likely 
to differ: if so, amend as necessary.) 
 
<p>
The effect of the <b>shell</b>, <b>xshell</b> or <b>winexec</b> command is to
fire up the executable for <b>vim</b> and pass along the arguments (none, one
or more, usually filenames) to that executable as <b>`*'</b>. That is, once you
have put these commands in a file <b>vim.ado</b> along your <a
href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?adopath">adopath</a>, you can type within
Stata <b>vim mydo.do</b> or <b>vim myprog.ado</b> and <b>vim</b> will open with
that file loaded. When you close the editor, you will return to Stata. 

<p> 
Commented out in these programs, but possibly useful, is a 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?discard">discard</a> command, which clears
all programs from Stata's memory. This is a brute force way of ensuring that,
when editing an <b>ado</b> file, there is never any discrepancy between the
programs defined by one or more just-edited files and those in Stata's memory
from the previous times the programs were defined. The very small overhead
incurred in obliging Stata to clear all programs is in my experience trivial
compared with the occasional loss of time spent puzzling over results and then
realising and fixing the fact that Stata is still using the version of the
program in memory. This <b>discard</b> statement need not, and should not, be
used if you never edit <b>ado</b> files to change them.

<p>(John D. Boy) See 
<a href="http://www.karpfenteich.net/pit/vimall.html">
http://www.karpfenteich.net/pit/vimall.html</a> 
for information on a free for private use program called <b>shortcut</b>
with which you can define a shortcut-keystroke to launch <b>vim</b> 
from every Windows application and later jump back to the original 
application with another keystroke. 
(If you prefer using another editor,  you can adapt the shortcut-macros 
to work with any other Windows 32-bit editor you like.) 

<p>(Dimitriy V. Masterov) This guide explains how to run Stata do-files from
<b>vim</b> on a Windows XP machine using the free scripting language called
AutoIt. This method will map <b>F8</b> to save and run the whole file, and
<b>F9</b> to run part of the file you have selected in visual mode or with
ordinary highlighting. The mappings will work both in visual and insert modes.

<ol><li>Make sure you have Vim 7.0 installed. The <b>F9</b> mapping will not
work without it.

<li>Follow the instructions for installing AutoIt and compiling Script 1 that
are posted on F. Huebler's website at 
<a href="http://huebler.info/2005/20050310_Stata_editor.html">
http://huebler.info/2005/20050310_Stata_editor.html</a>.  You
don't need Script 2. I've called the compiled script <b>rundo.exe</b> 
in what follows.

<li>Add the code below to your <b>_gvimrc</b> file, which is located in the 
Vim folder.
You will need to change the path and name of the compiled Script 1 to reflect
what you did in step 2. You will do this twice.

<h3><a name="mac">Macintosh editors</a></h3>

<h4><a name="macgen">General comments (Ron&#225;n Conroy, Phil Schumm)</a></h4>

<p>
A check on any download site will reveal a number of text editors available for
the Macintosh. See, for example,
<a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/index.shtml">Version Tracker</a>. 
Don't forget that the Macintosh comes with its own text editor, Simple Text
(Classic Mac OS) or TextEdit (OS X).  Simple Text is limited to small files and
offers only limited facilities for writing programs.  TextEdit is more
powerful, but still lacks essential features for text editing.

<p>Of various free cross-platform editors, <a href="textEditors.html#emacs">Emacs</a>, <a
href="textEditors.html#jedit">jEdit</a> and <a href="textEditors.html#vim">vim</a> all are under continual
development, rich and powerful, and essentically identical across platforms.
The first two have modes specifically designed for editing <b>(a)do</b> files.
For more details, see the respective entries. 
 
<p> 
<!-- Unfortunately, the Stata commands that permit you to communicate with the
operating system (i.e., <b>shell</b>, <b>xshell</b> and <b>winexec</b>) 
are not available on the
Macintosh.  Thus, in order to switch to an external editor easily from
within Stata, you must use one of the many third-party utilities that
permit you to launch an application using a particular combination of
keystrokes (note that if the editor is already running, you can simply use
<b>Command-Tab</b> to switch applications). -->
Communication from a text editor
to Stata can be accomplished nicely via Apple Events. Although Stata
currently only supports the four required events &#150; open application, open
file, quit, and print &#150; these are sufficient to accomplish the level of
integration provided by Stata's own Do-file editor.  For example, if your
editor will permit you to execute an AppleScript and pass it the name of
the file you are currently editing (referred to here as <b>myfile</b>), then
the following simple script will switch to Stata and execute the file:

<b><pre>
tell application "StataSE"
	activate
	open file ":myfile.do"
end tell
</pre></b>

<p> 
To specify an absolute path, enter

<b><pre>
tell application "StataSE"
	activate
	open file "Macintosh HD:Users:someuser:Desktop:myfile.do"
end tell
</pre></b>

<p>Alternatively, without AppleScript, the Stata command (for example) 

<b><pre>
. shell bbedit -c my.do
</pre></b> 

<p>
will open <b>BBEdit</b> to create <b>my.do</b> in the current working 
directory, and then close the file. You can then 

<b><pre>
. do my
</pre></b> 

<p>
You can edit the file again with

<b><pre>
. shell bbedit my.do
</pre></b> 

<h4><a name="bbedit">BBEdit and TextWrangler (Ron&#225;n Conroy, Benjamin Hulley, Christopher F. Baum)</a></h4> 

<p> 
<a href="http://www.barebones.com/index.html">Bare Bones</a> have a simple and
powerful marketing strategy: they make a version of their text editor available
free, to encourage you to try it.  
<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler</a>, 
which replaced <b>BBEdit Lite</b>, is
swift and responsive, and its features include powerful find-and-replace
(including multiple files), detection and removal of high-ASCII characters,
auto indent, line numbers and cursor position display. Like Stata's Do-File
Editor, <b>TextWrangler</b> will balance brackets, and when you type a right
bracket the corresponding left bracket flashes. The interface is ergonomic and 
uncluttered. The biggest advantage of <b>TextWrangler</b> is the speed 
with which it processes large files. 

<p> 
<b>TextWrangler</b> may whet your appetite for 
<b>BBEdit</b> (US$179, US$119 academic), which has
valuable additional features, including powerful HTML tools and 
additional shell support. For a detailed comparison, see 
<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/threeway.shtml">
http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/threeway.shtml</a>. 

<p>
Both <b>TextWrangler</b> and <b>BBEdit</b> support syntax coloring 
through a module downloadable from 
<a href="http://dataninja.wordpress.com/2006/02/28/stata-language-module-for-textwrangler/">
http://dataninja.wordpress.com/2006/02/28/stata-language-module-for-textwrangler/</a>. 

<p>
Better integration of <b>TextWrangler</b> or <b>BBEdit</b> with Stata can be
achieved through the  use of AppleScripts which will send commands or a file of
commands to Stata for execution.  These scripts should be placed in (e.g.)
<b>TextWrangler</b>'s scripts  folder <b>~/Library/Application
Support/TextWrangler Support/Scripts/</b>. Both <b>TextWrangler</b> and
<b>BBEdit</b> allow you to assign key commands to AppleScripts, which lets you
execute files with simple key combinations.  To  assign a key stroke go to the
<b>Window</b> menu and select <b>Palettes</b>, then <b>Scripts</b>, and choose
key combinations you find convenient.  I (Ben  Hulley) use
<b>command-shift-l</b> and <b>command-shift-k</b>.  
<!-- this one appears broken too 
Other  AppleScripts
designed for use with these editors are available at 
<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/benhulley/depot/">Ben's Mac OS X Software Source</a>.  
I welcome submissions from anyone who has Scripts  of their own.
The AppleScripts may be freely modified, and can  probably be made to work with
any AppleScriptable text editor.
-->

<p>
BareBones editors also include a tool which enables a quick transition from  
Stata to your chosen editor.  In either editor's preferences under the  
<b>Application</b> pane, select the <b>Install 'Edit' Tool</b>
to install a command line activator. Then from within Stata type:

<b><pre>
. // create a new file named "myfile.do" in the current directory
. winexec edit -c myfile.do

. // move to editor without creating a file
. winexec edit -l
	
. // move to editor and opens myfile.do (if myfile.do exists)
. winexec edit myfile.do
</pre></b> 

<p>
To avoid excess typing, create an ado file similar to the following:

<b><pre>
program twedit
	version 8.2
	winexec edit `*'
end
</pre></b> 

<p>
Then the command

<b><pre>
. winexec edit -c myfile.do
</pre></b>

<p>becomes

<b><pre>
. twedit -c myfile.do
</pre></b>

<p>
Additionally both <b>BBEdit</b> and <b>TextWrangler</b> have the ability to
open  from and save to an FTP server, which makes the two workable
alternatives to a Unix/Linux-based editor for those who are not using  XWindows
servers on the desktop Macintosh.  One can open a file on the  Unix system,
have it in a window on the Mac desktop, hit <b>Save</b> to revise  the copy on
the Unix/Linux system (via FTP transfer, all in the background)  and click into a
telnet window to run the revised program.  I (Kit  Baum) find it to be quite
superior alternative to using a different  editor when I am working on Unix/Linux 
than I use on my desktop Mac, and  the feature set, as noted above, is very
rich and powerful.

<p> 
<b>Smultron</b> from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smultron">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smultron</a> is a free, open-source  
text editor
written in Cocoa for Mac OS X Panther. It has a neat, elegant interface,
especially suited to managing groups of files (projects). It has line
numbering, support for syntax coloring in a number of languages  
including
Stata, multiple text
encodings, code snippets, a toolbar, a status bar, HTML preview,  
multi-document
find and replace with regular expressions, display of invisible

authenticated saves, command-line utility and .Mac synchronisation of
preferences. <b>Smultron</b> looks and feels a lot like <a
href="textEditors.html#subethaedit">SubEthaEdit</a>. Both are well suited to people  
who are new
to text editors. Smultron's advantages are that it
recognises Stata syntax (including many user-contributed ados from

the need to install any additional files or make any modifications
and it continues to be free, while <b>SubEthaEdit</b> is now shareware
(although old versions continue to be free).



<h4><a name="subethaedit">SubEthaEdit (Fredrik Wallenberg)</h4>

<p> 
<a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/">The Coding Monkeys</a> have an
innovative editor that is entirely Cocoa-based (as of February 2006 US$35,
US$19.95 academic).  <a
href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>'s most
noticeable feature is real-time collaboration: multiple users can work on the
same document at the same time, seeing each other's edits as they go.  However,
<b>SubEthaEdit</b> is a fully-fledged text editor in its own right, with full
support for regular expression search and replace, syntax coloring, bracket
matching etc.

<p> 
However, there are <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/
old.html">free versions</a> for both current and older (10.2) of OS X.  These
are full-featured text editors which support Stata syntax  highlighting.

<p> 
Stata syntax coloring is provided through a mode file provided by
Fredrik Wallenberg based on the <a href="textEditors.html#bbedit">BBEdit</a> module by Benjamin Hulley. It
identifies comments, strings, macros and functions by different
colors. User-defined functions (<b>ado</b> files) that are included (very few
at present) are italicized. The mode file needs to be installed in
<b>~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/</b> (or the
equivalent for your system or network-wide libraries). If the folder
does not exist, it should be created. Note that you need to relaunch
the editor to enable the language mode.

<p> 
The Stata.mode file is available at: 
<a href="http://sims.berkeley.edu/~fredrik/files">http://sims.berkeley.edu/~fredrik/files</a>

<p>From the <b>SubEthaEdit</b> homepage: 
<blockquote>
<b>SubEthaEdit</b> does integrate with FTP Clients which support the ODB
editor suite. This includes Interarchy, Fetch, NetFinder,
Cyberduck, FTPeel, Fugu and Transmit. Just configure <b>SubEthaEdit</b> as an
external editor in these applications. From now on you can fire up
your FTP client, chose "Edit with SubEthaEdit" and have changes
uploaded automatically on save.

<h3><a name="unix">Unix editors</a></h3>

<h4><a name="unixgen">General comments</a></h4>

<p>
(Here Unix is defined very broadly, to include flavours of Linux as well.)
For many years, there have been two especially prominent editors on Unix and
similar operating systems, <b>vi</b> or <b>vim</b> and <b>Emacs</b>.  Both 
are packed with features, and both have a moderately steep learning curve, yet
they are very different in style. There has long been part-serious,
part-jocular argument in Unix user communities about their relative merits. For 
one survey of these two editors and some others, not without its own bias, 
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s02.html">
http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s02.html</a>. 

<p>For cartoon expressions of this rivalry, see

<a  href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20000510">

<p>For mugs, mousemats and T-shirts, see 
<a href="http://www.geekcheat.com">http://www.geekcheat.com</a>. 

<p>
Both of these editors have been ported to other platforms, including 
Macintosh and Windows, and so they are here regarded as cross-platform 
editors and documented above under the headings <a href="textEditors.html#emacs">Emacs</a>
and <a href="textEditors.html#vim">vim</a>. 

<p>In addition to the specific sources of information mentioned above, many
general texts on Unix give introductory or reference chapters on these editors.
Two good examples are Paul W. Abrahams and Bruce A. Larson, <i>UNIX for the
impatient</i>, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 2nd edition 1996 and Arnold
Robbins, <i>Unix in a nutshell</i>, O'Reilly, Sebastopol, CA, 4th edition 2005. 

<h4><a name="kate">Kate and Kwrite (Edwin Leuven)</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://kate.kde.org">Kate</a> (and <b>Kwrite</b>, a trimmed down
version) is an easy-to-use and versatile editor that comes with <a
href="http://www.kde.org">the K Desktop Environment (KDE)</a>.  Users coming
from Windows will find <b>Kate</b> and <b>Kwrite</b> especially intuitive to
use.

<p>
KDE 3.4 and later ship a Stata syntax highlighting file by default. If 
not present, the Stata syntax file (and installation instructions) can 
be found in the syntax area of the <b>Kate</b> website at 
<a href="http://kate.kde.org/syntax/">http://kate.kde.org/syntax/</a>. 
The most convenient way of installing the Stata syntax file is through the menu
in the editor: Settings &gt; Configure &gt; Highlighting &gt; Download.  
Selecting Stata and clicking "Install" will download and install the syntax file. 

<h4><a name="pico">pico (Christopher F. Baum)</a></h4>

<p> 
This lightweight editor, available as a component of the pine
email client distribution (<a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">
http://www.washington.edu/pine/</a>), is very attractive for
those who are connecting to a Unix/Linux system with telnet. Although its
feature set is very limited, it has the great advantage of displaying its
commands at the foot of the screen, so no memorization is required. Using
the desktop system's facilities to copy and paste, it is possible to work
quite effectively in pine if one's needs are limited to modest revisions
to Stata programs, and support for remote XWindows use is limited (e.g.
over a PPP dialup modem connection, or from another continent).

<p> 
An introduction to Pico is given by Deborah S. Ray and Eric J. Ray, 
<i>Visual quickstart guide: UNIX</i>, Peachpit Press, Berkeley, CA, 
1998, pp.64-72 (2nd edition, 2003, pp.72-77). 

<p>(addition from A.J. Rossini:) While <b>pico</b> is extremely attractive,
and shares some keybinding with <a href="textEditors.html#emacs">Emacs</a>, it has
been my experience that it seems to be extremely difficult to jump
from <b>pico</b> to <b>Emacs</b>, much more than from just
about any other editor, so one might think carefully about this
choice.  (The same applies for converting from <b>pico</b> to 
<a href="textEditors.html#vim">vim</a>.)

<h3><a name="windows">Windows editors</a></h3>

<h4><a name="notepad">Notepad and Wordpad (Nicholas J. Cox)</a></h4> 

<p>As many Windows users will know, two editors are provided with all versions
of Windows in extensive use at present. The great advantage, and the great
disadvantage, of <b>Notepad</b> is that it is very simple.  It can also not
read large files.  <b>Wordpad</b> has more features, and can read larger files,
but both are very limited by comparison with the other editors described in
this FAQ.  If you are accustomed to Windows ways, and especially if you make
extensive use of MS Word, they will probably appear easy to use, even on first
acquaintance, being quite menu-driven. 

<p> 
Stata for Windows users can open <b>Notepad</b> independently of Stata, or
within Stata. For the latter, type in the command window <b>winexec
notepad</b>, optionally specifying the name of the file to be edited. See help on 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?winexec">winexec</a>. (Or 
do so via an <b>ado</b> file, as explained in more detail under 
<b><a href="textEditors.html#vim">vim</a></b> above.) 

<p> 
<b>Wordpad</b> is perhaps better viewed as a very limited word processor,
rather than an enhanced text editor.  It defaults to a proportional font and
RTF (rich text format) for saving files.  If you try to write (for example)
Stata <b>do</b> files in <b>Wordpad</b> you may have considerable problems saving them
with the extension <b>do</b>, trying to get Stata to read your RTF file, etc.
Although <b>Wordpad</b> has many extra features compared with <b>Notepad</b>,
these are essentially word processing features and are of no use for editing
text files.  Hence I do not recommend it for that purpose. 

<p>
Nevertheless, for completeness, note that the same <b>winexec</b> device does
not appear to work for <b>Wordpad</b> unless the full path leading to the
executable is specified. In practice, therefore, it would be better to call up
<b>Wordpad</b> with something like the following minimal Stata program.  Check
that the executable is in the place specified here in your version of Windows,
and amend as necessary.

<b><pre>
program wordpad
	version 8 
	winexec "c:\program files\accessories\wordpad.exe" `*' 
end 
</pre></b> 

<p> 
Once you have put these commands in a file <b>wordpad.ado</b> along your 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?adopath">adopath</a>, you may open 
<b>Wordpad</b> by typing in the command window <b>wordpad</b>, optionally 
specifying the name of the file to be edited. (For more comments on this 
approach, especially for those editing <b>ado</b> files, see under 
<b><a href="textEditors.html#vim">vim</a></b> above.)

<h4><a name="context">ConTEXT (Stephen McKay)</a></h4>

<p><b>ConTEXT</b> is a small, fast and powerful text editor for Windows 
written by Eden Kirin, a student at Zagreb University in  Croatia.  
It was developed mainly as a tool for software developers and features
syntax highlighting for many programming languages. It is free, 
and may be downloaded from <a href="http://www.context.cx/">
http://www.context.cx/</a>. 

<p>My previous text editor was <b><a href="textEditors.html#pfe">PFE</a></b>, 
and I find <b>ConTEXT</b> a more than worthy successor.

<p><b>ConTEXT</b> is robust.  It claims to open files of unlimited size, and I 
can vouch for that up to tens of megabytes.  It will also open an
unlimited number of files: this certainly works well with several dozen.  
That's great for then doing a search/replace in all open files, or just 
the active file.

<p>It has a Stata (7SE) environment for syntax highlighting.  This 
works well with Stata 8, only failing to highlight <i>some</i> of the new 
graphics commands, but that should be easy to amend.

<p><b>ConTEXT</b> allows column-based text selection and operations, which 
is often helpful (e.g. for extracting a column of figures from output).

<p>Other features include maintaining backups; 
auto-indent options; conversion from DOS to Unix/Linux and Macintosh file formats; 
and commenting/uncommenting code.

<p>The package is written by one person, in response to his dislike of 
current editors. This does lend a kind of purity and simplicity of 
design. <b>ConTEXT</b> is Pricelessware 2006, 'the best of the best in Freeware', 
as determined by the readers of alt.comp.freeware. See
<a href="http://www.pricelessware.org/">http://www.pricelessware.org/</a>. 

<h4><a name="crimson">Crimson (Rosa Gini)</a></h4>

<p>The <b>Crimson</b> editor from <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/">
http://www.crimsoneditor.com/</a> is a free editor for Windows, 
so small that it can be held on a floppy disk. Syntax highlighting 
for HTML, C/C++, Perl, Java, Matlab and LaTeX is automatic, and for Stata 
is obtained after writing the files <b>extension.do</b> and 
<b>extension.ado</b> containing the two lines

<b><pre>
LANGSPEC:STATA.SPC
KEYWORDS:STATA.KEY
</pre></b> 

<p>in the directory <b>link</b> of the program. 
In fact support for dozens of languages is implemented 
under this editor, and any new language can be added easily.

<p>I love this editor: it is so simple and versatile. 
One of its many features is that text can be edited in 
column mode: that is, you can copy and paste rectangular 
selections, which can be very useful when programming. 
Stata <b>do</b> or <b>ado</b> files can be launched 
from within the editor after programming a user tool.

<h4><a name="editplus">EditPlus (Lee E. Sieswerda)</a></h4>

<p> <b>EditPlus</b> (<a
href="http://www.editplus.com/">http://www.editplus.com</a>) is a full-featured
shareware text editor (as of February 2006 US$30 after 30-day trial period). It is
currently available only on the Windows platform. The shareware version is
fully enabled and retains its functionality even after the 30-day trial period.

<p> <b>EditPlus</b> has an extensive list of features for all types of
programmers. A non-exhaustive list of features that I use daily and that would
be of interest to Stata users would include:

<p>
<ul>
	<li>multiple files open at the same time
	<li>syntax highlighting for every programming language I've ever heard of, including Stata (Note: this syntax highlighting file is only current up to Stata 6)
	<li>user-specified tools that allow you to run the currently open file in Stata
	<li>line numbering and bookmarking
	<li>the ability to group a whole set of analysis files together into a project
	<li>auto-indent and brace-matching
	<li>column selection (useful when editing columns of data)
	<li>search and replace engine that can handle regular expressions
	<li>multiple undo/redo and automatic back-ups
	<li>customizable keyboard shortcuts and keystroke macros
	<li>a directory window for quick selection of files
</ul>

<p> Another nice feature is the ability to define document templates. Most of
us probably have a little incantation that we use to begin our Stata files. For
example, I start each Stata <b>do</b> file with:

<p>
<b><pre>
* Comments
* Author: Lee Sieswerda, date
capture log close
log using *.log, replace
set more off
...
log close
</pre></b> 

<p>
In order to avoid typing this every time I start a new <b>do</b> file, I have
it set as my default Stata document template in <b>EditPlus</b>.

<p>
For those who make their Stata files available on the Internet, <b>EditPlus</b>
has integrated FTP support and a preview web browser (which was quite helpful
in drafting this contribution to the FAQ). Also, judging by the large number of
user-written syntax, auto-completion, and cliptext files that are available on
the <b>EditPlus</b> website, there appears to be a fairly extensive user
community. 

<p>
I have used some of the other editors listed in this FAQ and compared them with
<b>EditPlus</b>. <b>EditPlus</b> lacks the scripting language of <a
href="textEditors.html#notetab">NoteTab</a>, but <b>NoteTab</b> lacks syntax highlighting and I
personally found its interface inelegant. <b>EditPlus</b> is more full-featured
than <a href="textEditors.html#pfe">PFE</a>, but then PFE is free.  <b>EditPlus</b> is not
nearly as powerful as <a href="textEditors.html#emacs">Emacs</a> (what editor is?), but it is
considerably easier to learn to use. Most recently, I have been using <a
href="textEditors.html#emeditor">EmEditor</a>, which I have found very nice indeed.

<p>
And finally, I have only a couple of complaints about <b>EditPlus</b>. First,
the <b>EditPlus</b> directory window only allows you to open files, not rename
or delete them. Second, while you can configure a user-defined tool to pass the
current file to Stata via the command line, it will always create a new
instance of Stata. Since first writing this section of the FAQ, I have come to
realize that this has more to with the way Stata is designed than EditPlus. See
the discussion on <a href="textEditors.html#emacs">ESS</a> for more insight.  In any case,
there is a partial workaround: create a master <b>do</b> file that lists all of
the <b>do</b> files you want to run and send that to Stata, rather than the
individual files. Obviously, this still does not give the flexibility of
Stata's built-in text editor, but can be useful in some circumstances. 

<p>
Of course, these are very minor irritations and should not
prevent anyone from giving <b>EditPlus</b> a try.

<p>It would be easy to write an <b>ado</b> for <b>EditPlus</b>
along the lines of that for <b><a href="textEditors.html#notepad">Wordpad</a></b> above.

<h4><a name="emeditor">EmEditor (Friedrich Huebler)</a></h4>

<p><b>EmEditor</b> is a text editor for Windows by Emurasoft. A fully
functional 30-day trial version can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.emeditor.com">
http://www.emeditor.com</a>. 
As of May 2006, a single-user license for <b>EmEditor</b> version 5 costs
US$29.99 (Standard) or US$39.99 (Professional). EmEditor is also offered in a free version 
with fewer features.

</p><p> 
<b>EmEditor</b> supports multi-platform files (Macintosh, Unix/Linux
and Windows), multiple files can be open simultaneously, and the size of text
files is only limited by the amount of memory. Features of interest for Stata
users include:</p><ul>
<li>support for external tools: launch external programs (e.g., Stata) via keyboard shortcuts or toolbar buttons
</li><li>syntax highlighting: a Stata syntax file by Friedrich Huebler can be
downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.emurasoft.com/emeditor3/userfiles.php">
http://www.emurasoft.com/emeditor3/userfiles.php</a>
</li><li>support for macros and plugins: various free plugins are available at the
<b>EmEditor</b> Web site
</li><li>customizable keyboard shortcuts and toolbar
</li><li>sophisticated search and replace, with support for regular expressions
</li><li>find and replace in files 
</li><li>open documents in multiple windows, or in a single window with tabs
</li><li>split window (up to four panes)
</li><li>parentheses/brackets matching
</li><li>line numbering
</li><li>auto indent 
</li><li>multiple undo and redo
</li><li>auto save
</li><li>editor is small and fast
</li></ul> 

<p> 
It would be easy to write an <b>ado</b> for <b>EmEditor</b> 
along the lines of that for <b><a href="textEditors.html#notepad">Wordpad</a></b> above.
In addition, Friedrich Huebler has written two AutoIt scripts that make it
possible to execute Stata commands directly from <b>EmEditor</b>. 
See the section on <a href="textEditors.html#autoit">
Integrating Stata and external editors with AutoIt</a>. 

<h4><a name="notepadplus">Notepad++ (Lee E. Sieswerda)</a></h4>

<p><b>Notepad++</b> is a freeware editor for Windows downloadable from 
<a href = "http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net">
http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net</a>. 
It is actively maintained, as of January 2006. 

<p>It has many great features, including:

<p>
<ul>
<li>syntax highlighting via a unique, built-in graphical user language definition system (see below)
<li>code folding
<li>tabbed multiple document interface 
<li>ability to save your "session" (i.e., a list of the files associated with a particular project)
<li>column selection mode (just hold down Alt key while selecting)
<li>vertical and horizontal window splitting to get multiple "views" of a file
<li>line numbering, line bookmarking 
<li>auto-indent, brace matching, and brace highlighting
<li>regular expressions and multiple file search, mark and replace
<li>multiple undo/redo
<li>customizable keyboard shortcuts and keystroke macros
<li>zooming for those with sore eyes from staring at computer screens
<li>auto-completion
<li>extensive feature enhancements via a plug-in system
<li>comes in both "installer" and "zipped" versions for people who don't have admin rights on their work computer
</ul>

<p>I think the syntax highlighting interface deserves special mention here
because it is quite distinctive. At any time you can click a button and a
tabbed dialog appears that spells out all of your syntax highlighting settings
for a given language. This allows you to modify your highlighting
choices flexibly and on the fly. The result is that you get near perfect syntax
highlighting. This is more important than it seems on the surface. Near perfect
syntax highlighting means that you can more effectively find errors in your
code because when you notice something amiss visually, it is almost certainly a
coding problem and not just a flaw in the syntax highlighting. Plus, if you
download a command from SSC you can add it to the list of highlighted words
instantly and right within the interface - no need to search out and edit the
the syntax definition file. The syntax highlighting options are very detailed
and complete, allowing you to modify virtually any detail you can think of
quickly and easily.

<p>It is also worth noting that you do not need to find and download a syntax 
definition file to get started. Just download the
user-written Stata command <b>getcmds</b> from SSC. 
It provides you with a list of all of Stata's official commands, which you
can then paste into the <b>Notepad++</b> syntax highlighting definition system.

<p>
The only deficiency I have experienced with <b>Notepad++</b> is that there 
isn't a built-in help system. If you have trouble using a 
particular feature, you have to consult the website. 
This is only a serious problem if your corporate firewall
inexplicably blocks access to SourceForge, which hosts the 
<b>Notepad++</b> website. That should not be a problem for most people.

</p><h4><a name="notetab">NoteTab (Ross A. Odell)</a></h4> 

<b>NoteTab</b> is an inexpensive and versatile text editor 
from Eric Fookes, Fookes Software, Geneva at 
<a href="http://www.notetab.com/">http://www.notetab.com</a>. 
It comes in three versions (as of February 2006): 
<B>NoteTab Light</B> (free), <B>NoteTab Standard</B> (US$9.95) and 
<B>NoteTab Pro</B> (US$19.95). 
All versions will match
brackets; have optional auto-indentation as well as block indent/unindent; 
and allow cut/copy/paste of rectangular blocks of
text using special block submenu commands. 
<b>NoteTab</b> will detect when an open <b>log</b> file has been
modified and ask if you want to reload it. 

<p>
<b>NoteTab</b> does not have a capability for syntax highlighting, other than
for HTML in <b>NoteTab Pro</b>. Such a capability is in the pipeline, I was
told.

<p>
The potentially most useful feature of <b>NoteTab</b> (all versions, though
Light might be nobbled a bit) is the scripting language which enables complex
editing tasks and facilitates interaction with other applications.  According
to Help: "<b>NoteTab</b> integrates seamless support for Perl and
Gawk interpreters; scripts can be stored in <b>NoteTab</b>'s Clipbook
and applied directly to highlighted text or the whole document." I can't vouch
for that, but I will simply describe some of my own experience with
<b>NoteTab</b>.

<p>I have used <b>NoteTab</b> (for <b>MATLAB</b>, mostly) for several years,
since when it was <b>MiniNoteTab</b>, for low-level stuff, not using any of the
advanced features as they were introduced. Recently I wanted to improve the
interface between editor and Stata, specifically to emulate Stata's
editor. With a modest investment of time I managed to do that, with two clips
that enable one to
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?do">do</a> or 
<a href="http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?run">run</a> 
selected lines of code or the entire file directly from <b>NoteTab</b>. These
are available from <a href="http://www.notetab.com/other.htm">
http://www.notetab.com/other.htm</a>. 

<p>Then I explored <b>NoteTab</b>'s (Std or Pro) <b>outline</b> documents. 
These are structured documents that are displayed in two windows, headings on
the left, the text associated with the highlighted heading on the right. I
found this a convenient way to organize by topic (regression, ANOVA, etc.)
the <b>do</b> files I have written for teaching. Click on a heading, click 
on a file name, right-click/open file at cursor, click on <b>run</b>...Seamless.

<p>Finally, to create the original file list I wrote a clip that lists all
<b>do</b> files in a specified directory along with the contiguous 
comments at the top of the file that begin with <b>*</b>. I have now 
done the same for listing <b>ado</b> files in <b>..\ado\personal\a-z</b>. 

<p>These simple tasks were accomplished without too steep a learning
curve. Of course the language looks difficult at first, 
but the clipbook help is convenient and <b>NoteTab</b> 
comes with sample clip libraries that are of some help. There is also a
resource of user-supplied clip libraries at <b>NoteTab</b>.

<p>(Guillaume Frechette:) Various extra tips: 
<ul>
<li>One feature that I have found useful is its ability to read
(and save) files in different formats.  Either through the File/Export menu or
through the Document menu you can (e.g.) select among DOS/Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux,
EBCDIC. 
 
<li>The Modify menu also has some useful commands such as Lines: Indent,
Unindent, ...; Text Case: switch to upper case, lower case, ...; Spaces: single
space, single tab. This is useful when dealing with data files which have
repeated spaces or tabs. It transforms any consecutive space (tab) to a single
one.
 
<li>The Document menu has a Second Window option which allows side-by-side
viewing of files.  
</ul>

along the lines of that for <b><a href="textEditors.html#notepad">Wordpad</a></b> above.

<h4><a name="pfe">PFE (Programmer's File Editor) (Roger Newson)</a></h4>

<p><b>PFE</b> is a freeware multi-file text editor written by Alan Phillips,
formerly of Lancaster University, UK, and is frequently mentioned on Statalist.
Note that the author stopped developing the editor in 1999, and does not answer
email questions on it. Nevertheless, 
<a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/steveb/cpaap/pfe/">
http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/steveb/cpaap/pfe/</a> contains links to download
sites. Moreover, <b>PFE</b> is still reliable and versatile,  
and continues to receive good reviews from users at its download sites.
Many of these reviews contain appeals to Alan Phillips to donate the code as
open source, so that other programmers can produce upgrades, but I am not aware
that this has happened, or is about to happen.

<p>A helpful feature of <b>PFE</b> is the ability to run DOS and Windows
applications from inside the editor. This can be done with a single mouse
click, without having to remember any command lines, by using <b>PFE</b>'s
customizable Execute menu, which the user can configure with up to 16 items,
each with a menu name of the user's choice.  For instance, the user might want
to launch Stata or run TeX from inside <b>PFE</b>, starting in the same
directory as a file currently being edited.  Optionally, output from DOS and
Windows applications may be captured in a command window inside <b>PFE</b>.

<p>I have used <b>PFE</b> since 1997. From 1997 to 2002, it was the default
application on my system for opening most files, including Stata <b>do</b>,
<b>ado</b>, <b>log</b> and  <b>smcl</b> files. In 2002, when my desktop machine
was upgraded, I replaced <b>PFE</b> with <b><a href="textEditors.html#textpad">TextPad</a></b>,
which has most of the same capabilities (and a little bit more), but which is
not free. This was done as a precautionary measure in case <b>PFE</b> did not
work under the new system (Windows 98 SE). As it happened, <b>PFE</b> did work
under the new system, and the advantages of <b><a
href="textEditors.html#textpad">TextPad</a></b> over <b>PFE</b> are small (I think), but by
then I had already paid for <b><a href="textEditors.html#textpad">TextPad</a></b>.

<p>It would be easy to write an <b>ado</b> for <b>PFE</b>
along the lines of that for <b><a href="textEditors.html#notepad">Wordpad</a></b> above.

<h4><a name="textpad">TextPad (J. Scott Long)</a></h4>

<p> 
<b>TextPad</b> is a shareware text editor from  
<a href="http://www.textpad.com/">http://www.textpad.com</a>.  Prices for a
single-user licence (as of February 2006) are modest at (e.g.) US$30 or
&pound;16.50 + VAT. I have found <b>TextPad</b> reliable and versatile. 

<p>
TextPad has not had a major update since July 2003. While it has many
valuable features (including multiple windows, macros, replace using
regular expressions, a clip library where you can add bits of code that
you use regularly for easy insertion into later programs), it is beginning
to feel a bit dated. It can also be customized to use the keystrokes that you prefer.  If you want a text editor
with a strong Windows flavour, <b>TextPad</b> would be an excellent choice. It is
frequently mentioned on Statalist. 
 
<p> 
Syntax highlighting for Stata 6, 7 and 8 files is possible with syntax files
produced by <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/">J. Scott Long</a>. 
The latest version is downloadable from 
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/files/software/textpad/stata.syn">
http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/files/software/textpad/stata.syn</a>.
An earlier version is downloadable from 
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/files/software/textpad/stata6.syn">
http://www.indiana.edu/~jslsoc/files/software/textpad/stata6.syn</a>. 
In essence, these file are
long lists of Stata commands and keywords, which are colored distinctly within
<b>TextPad</b>. Note that the files at Scott's site are more
up-to-date than that from the 
<a href="http://www.textpad.com/add-ons/synn2t.html">TextPad</a> site.

<p>Various hints by Ivar Pettersen on enabling syntax highlighting, running a
<b>do</b> file in Stata in the background, running selected text in Stata, and
working with Unix/Linux Stata from a Windows perspective can be found at

<h4><a name=ultraedit>UltraEdit (Devra Golbe, Timothy J. Wade)</a></h4>

<p><b>UltraEdit</b> is a shareware text editor developed by Ian David Mead and
available from <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com">http://www.ultraedit.com</a>.
As of February 2006 a single-user license costs US$39.95. We have found
it fast, stable, and reliable.  <b>UltraEdit</b> has many features  useful for
programming in many languages.  These include support for: 
 
<p>  
<ul>
   <li>handling of huge files
   <li>multiple open windows, and split windows
   <li>Unix/Linux/Mac files as well as Windows
   <li>regular expressions
   <li>operations across multiple files: find and replace and identification
   of differences between files
   <li>column mode editing
   <li>automatic line and column numbering
   <li>automatic indentation and bracket matching
   <li>syntax highlighting, including a Stata 7 syntax file (author unknown)
   downloadable from 
<a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/index.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=40#wordfiles">
http://www.ultraedit.com/index.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=40#wordfiles</a>
   <li>macros, including recording macros
   <li>seamless FTP access to remote servers without the extra steps of
downloading/uploading with a separate FTP program, including secure access (SFTP-SSH2)
to servers behind firewalls. 
  <li>templates which can be defined to store text fragments used over and
  over
  <li>user-defined tools. 
</ul>   
  
<p>To configure <b>UltraEdit</b> to open Stata and run the file open in
<b>UltraEdit</b>, go to <b>Advanced</b> and then <b>Tool Configuration</b>.
Suppose that you name your menu item <b>Stata SE</b> and set the working directory
to <b>d:\</b>. The command line should read (modify executable as needed) 
 
<b>
<pre>
c:\stata\wsestata.exe do  "%f"
</pre>
</b> 
 
<p><b>Stata SE</b> now appears on the bottom of the <b>Advanced</b> menu, so 
that clicking on it brings up Stata and runs the current file.
 
<p>It would be easy to write an <b>ado</b> for <b>UltraEdit</b>
along the lines of that for <b><a href="textEditors.html#notepad">Wordpad</a></b> above.

<h4><a name=winedt>WinEdt (Joao Pedro W. de Azevedo, Jean Ries)</a></h4>

<p>
<b>WinEdt</b> (<a href="http://www.winedt.com/">http://www.winedt.com</a>) 
is a flexible and versatile native editor and shell for MS Windows with a 
strong predisposition towards the creation of LaTeX documents. Despite this 
predisposition it can be put to other uses (e.g. writing Stata code)
in a rather neat way. (Please note that there is also a distinct and 
unrelated Windows text editor called WinEdit.)  

<p> 
<b>WinEdt</b> is distributed as shareware (try-before-you-buy software).  The
program may be used for an evaluation period of 31 days. Prices (as of February
2006) are US$30 for students, US$40 for educational users, and US$70 for
commercial users.  Site licences are also available.

<p> 
<b>WinEdt</b> allows the set-up of a Project, which will automatically relate a
set of associated files. I find this feature particularly useful when I am
working with many <b>do</b> files related to a single project. Some other
helpful features of <b>WinEdt</b> are delimiter matching, block selection, and
extended Find/Replace facilities.

<p> 
<b>WinEdt</b> also has a highly customizable interface and a quite powerful and 
well documented macro language. It also has a fairly large user community, 
with a good mailing list and a website designed exclusively for the purpose 
of sharing free user-written add-ons to <b>WinEdt</b> 
(<a href="http://www.winedt.org">http://www.winedt.org</a>). 

<p>
Stata users should note that Philip Greenwood has written a very complete and 
well documented module for Stata: see  
<a href="http://www.winedt.org/Config/modes/Stata.php">
http://www.winedt.org/Config/modes/Stata.php</a>. 
After installation of this, <b>WinEdt</b> will automatically recognize both
<b>do</b> and <b>ado</b> files, enabling several Stata-specific features, all
of which can be activated through either the menu-driven dialog boxes in the
Accessories menu, or short-cut keys.  The features include clever syntax
highlighting, active strings, running <b>do</b> files in batch mode and
interactively, running selected parts of a <b>do</b> file, and exporting Stata
highlighted syntaxes as HTML files.

<p> 
It would be easy to write an ado for <b>WinEdt</b> along the lines of that for
<b><a href="textEditors.html#notepad">Wordpad</a></b> above.
