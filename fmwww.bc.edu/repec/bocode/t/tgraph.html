Plot graph with transformed axes

Description
-----------
<p>
^tgraph^ produces a graph with one or two non-standard axes, whose labels are o
&gt; n
the same scale as yvarlist and/or xvar.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^xtrans()^ defines the transformation (function of xvar) to be used. The argume
&gt; nt
    of the function is represented by ^@@^. Standard Stata syntax is used. If y
&gt; ou
    specify ^xtrans()^ then you must also specify ^xlabel()^.
<p>
^ytrans()^ defines the transformation (function of all the variables in yvarlis
&gt; t)
    to be used. The rules for defining the function are the same as for
    ^xtrans()^. If you specify ^ytrans()^ then you must also specify ^ylabel()^
&gt; .
<p>
^xlabel()^, ^ylabel()^ are the required axis labels.
<p>
graph_options are any of Stata's @graph, twoway@ options except for ^xlabel()^ 
&gt; and
    ^ylabel()^.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
Stata provides automatic axis scaling only for linear (natural) and logarithmic
scales, the latter via the ^xlog^, ^ylog^ and ^rlog^ options of ^graph^. You ma
&gt; y want
more. For example, a square root transformation of the response or of a covar-
iate is sometimes useful, and you would like an axis to be scaled accordingly
but with the labels on the original scale of measurement. ^tgraph^ allows you t
&gt; o
do this in a flexible way. It exploits Stata's valuable facility to label an
axis automatically according to the score labels for the variable in question.
<p>
For example, suppose you want to transform a variable called ^weeks^ to a quad-
ratic polynomial function of it, for which the coefficients of the linear and
quadratic terms are stored in global macros called ^$b1^ and ^$b2^. You then wa
&gt; nt
to plot a variable called ^femur^ against ^weeks^ on the quadratically transfor
&gt; med
scale, labelling values on the X-axis with ^10,20,30,40^ weeks.
<p>
The quadratic function of ^weeks^ may be represented by the following expressio
&gt; n:
<p>
        ^$b1*weeks + $b2*weeks^^2^
<p>
The plot is produced using ^tgraph^ as follows:
<p>
 . ^tgraph femur weeks, xlabel(10(10)40) xtrans($b1*@@ + $b2*@@^^2)^
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
 . ^tgraph femur weeks, xlabel(10,20,30,40) xtrans(sqrt(@@))^
 . ^tgraph femur weeks, labels(10,20,30,40) xtrans($b1*@@ + $b2*@@^^2)^
 . ^tgraph y1 y2 y3 x, connect(lll) ylabel(1,2,3,4) ytrans(-1/@@)^
        ^xlabel(10(10)40) xtrans(sqrt(@@))^
