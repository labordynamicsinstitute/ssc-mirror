Change values of a variable to mode(s)
--------------------------------------
<p>
    ^tomode^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    ^,^ { ^g^enerate^(^newvar^)^ | ^replace^ }
    [ ^by(^byvarlist^)^ { ^uni^que | ^m^inmode } ^o^chmiss ^use^miss ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^tomode^ generates a new variable in which values of varname are changed
to equal the mode, or replaces varname in this way.
<p>
Alternatively, ^tomode^ may be regarded as a way of storing modes,
defined for all or some of the observations of varname or by groups of
observations of varname.
<p>
varname may be numeric or string.
<p>
The mode is by default the most common non-missing value. If there are
two or more values with the same maximum frequency, the highest mode (in
sort order) is used by default.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^generate(^newvar^)^ specifies that values are to be placed in the new
    variable newvar.
<p>
^replace^ specifies that varname is to be overwritten with any changed
    values.
<p>
One of these two options must be specified.
<p>
^by(^byvarlist^)^ specifies that operations are to be carried out
    separately for groups defined by byvarlist.
<p>
^unique^ specifies that changes should be made only if there is a unique
    mode: that is, no ties occur.
<p>
^minmode^ specifies that if there are two or more values with the same
    maximum frequency, the lowest mode (in sort order) is used.
<p>
^unique^ and ^minmode^ are mutually exclusive.
<p>
^ochmiss^ specifies that only missing values should be changed to the
    mode. Note: To protect missing values from change, exclude them by
    e.g.
    ^tomode^ ... ^if^ varname ^&lt; .^
<p>
^usemiss^ specifies that it is acceptable to use missing values in
    determination of the mode. That is, the mode itself may be missing.
