Description
-----------
<p>
^tabhbar^ is a driver for ^hbar^ that produces a horizontal bar chart of
the frequencies of the distinct values of either one or two categorical
variables.
<p>
With one variable, its values define the `rows' of the bar chart.
<p>
With two variables, their values define the `rows' and `columns' of the
bar chart, best explained by example.
<p>
Given the following frequencies (from ^tab for rep78^)

  Car type |         1          2          3          4          5 |     Total

  Domestic |         2          8         27          9          2 |        48
   Foreign |         0          0          3          9          9 |        21

<p>
in the default `long' form  given by ^tabhbar for rep78^, bars are in the
following order:
<p>
Domestic  1          2
          2          8
          3         27
          4          9
          5          2
Foreign   3          3
          4          9
          5          9
<p>
while in the `wide' form given by ^tabhbar for rep78, wide^, bars are stacked:
<p>
Domestic       2 + 8 + 27 + 9 + 2
Foreign        3 + 9 + 9
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^fsort^ specifies that bars are to be sorted by frequency, the bar with
     the lowest frequency being placed at the top of the chart. This
     applies only with one variable.
<p>
^rfsort^ specifies that bars are to be sorted by frequency, the bar with
     the highest frequency being placed at the top of the chart. This
     applies only with one variable.
<p>
^zero^ specifies that combinations with frequency zero are wanted.
     However, they will still be represented by invisible bars of zero
     height.
<p>
^rowpc^, ^rowpr^, ^rowfr^, ^colpc^, ^colpr^, ^colfr^ scale frequencies
     to be percents, adding to 100, or proportions (fractions), adding to 1,
     of the total of the row or column variable. ^rowpr^ and ^rowfr^
     are equivalent, as are ^colpr^ and ^colfr^. The ^col^*
     options are useful only when two variables are plotted.
<p>
^wide^ gives a stacked form of the bar chart. See above.
<p>
<p>
hbar_options are any options of ^hbar^.
