Generate Stata date variables from run-together date variables
--------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^todate7^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range], ^g^enerate^(^newvarlist^)^ 
    ^p^attern^(^patternspec^)^ [ ^f^ormat^(^format^)^ ^c^end^(^year^)^ ] 
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^todate7^ takes run-together date variables consisting of integers 
or integer characters and generates the corresponding Stata date variables.
<p>
<p>
Note that ^todate7^ was written for Stata 7. As of September 2005, users 
of Stata 8 or later should switch to using ^todate^. 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
As explained in [U] 27.2.2.2, Stata's ^date()^ function cannot convert 
run-together date variables which consist of integers or integer characters
and represent some permutation of years, months and days, with values such as 
^19520121^ or ^520121^ or ^"19520121"^, to Stata date variables. However, it 
is possible to use other numeric or string functions to extract year, month 
and day and then to compute the dates.
<p>
A similar problem and a similar solution arise with run-together dates 
representing years and one of half-years, quarters, months or weeks. 
<p>
^todate7^ offers an alternative. It can handle one or more numeric 
and/or string variables with run-together dates which are integers or 
integer characters, hereafter both referred to as digits.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^generate(^newvarlist^)^ specifies a list of new variable names to hold the 
    Stata date variables. There must be as many new names as there are 
    existing run-together date variables. This is a required option. 
<p>
^pattern(^patternspec^)^ specifies the pattern for interpreting digits in 
    the dates. 
    
    ^y^ indicates ^y^ear.
    ^h^ indicates ^h^alf-year. 
    ^q^ indicates ^q^uarter. 
    ^m^ indicates ^m^onth.
    ^w^ indicates ^w^eek. 
    ^d^ indicates ^d^ay.
<p>
    The patterns supported are of types ^mdy^, ^yh^, ^yq^, ^ym^ and ^yw^. 
    For example, type ^mdy^ consists of some permutation of ^m^s, ^d^s 
    and ^y^s. In general, all ^y^s, ... , all ^d^s should be contiguous.
      
    Thus ^p(yyyymmdd)^ indicates that ^19520121^ is to be interpreted as 
    1952 January 21. Dates like ^3281952^ and ^12251999^ for March 28 1952 
    and December 25 1999, in which the first digit for shorter dates is 
    not specified, but could be ^0^, should be specified as ^p(mmddyyyy)^.
    
    ^todate7^ cannot handle input variables whose maximum length does not 
    match the length of pattern specified, nor input variables whose non-
    missing values vary in length by more than 1 digit. Such variables are 
    skipped. 
    
    This is a required option. 
<p>
^cend(^year^)^ specifies the end of the century (any period of 100 years) to 
    which years belong. With ^cend(2000)^ year digits of ^52^ and ^99^ will be 
    interpreted as ^1952^ and ^1999^. With ^cend(2060)^ they will be interprete
&gt; d
    as ^2052^ and ^1999^. ^cend()^ is ignored if 4 digit years are given.  
<p>
^format(^format^)^ specifies a format to be attached to each new variable, 
    usually but not necessarily a date format. See help on @dfmt@ or @tfmt@.

Examples

    . ^todate7 d1 d2 d3, gen(ndate1-ndate3) p(yyyymmdd) f(%dd_m_cy)^ 
    . ^todate7 d1 d2 d3, gen(ndate1-ndate3) p(mmddyy) c(2000) f(%dd_m_cy)^ 
    . ^todate7 d1 d2 d3, gen(ndate1-ndate3) p(yyyyq) f(%tq_q_cy)^
