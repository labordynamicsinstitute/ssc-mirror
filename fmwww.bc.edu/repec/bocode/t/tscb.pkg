d 'TSCB': module to implement the two-stage cluster bootstrap estimator
d
d  This package implements the two-stage cluster bootstrap (TSCB)
d estimator described in Abadie et al., ("When Should You Adjust
d Standard Errors for Clustering?", QJE, 2023).  The TSCB estimator
d allows for the calculation of standard errors and confidence
d intervals for average treatment effects in both OLS and fixed
d effect regressions which account for both sampling uncertainty,
d and design-based uncertainty.  This bootstrap-based estimator can
d be more efficient than the standard cluster-robust variance
d estimator, particularly when the number of samples clustered
d approaches the total number of clusters in a population.
