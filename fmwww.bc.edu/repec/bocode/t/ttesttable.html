<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    ttesttable is a very simple Stata module that performs a
    mean-comparison test (t-Test) for all possible combinations of groups
    defined by a variable. For instance, if you have 4 types of
    observations and you would like to see if there are differences in
    means between groups, this module computes the t-test for all six
    possible combinations. The output is presented in a table of
    differences in means and includes the significance level of the t-test.
    This table can be exported directly as a LaTeX file and the underlying
    matrices are available for further use in Stata.
<p>
    <b>outcome</b> This variable must be numeric and contains the variable you
    would like to test.
<p>
    <b>groupvar</b> This variable must be a categorical variable with either
    numerical values or strings.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>uneq</u></b><b>ual</b> This option corresponds to the <i>unequal</i> option of the command
    <i>ttest</i>, meaning that no equal variances of the outcome variable are
    assumed for the two groups.
<p>
    <b><u>tex</u></b><b>(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b> Use this option to export the displayed table directly to
    latex. Specify the name of the file (without the file extension). The
    table will be generated with the LaTeX <i>tabular</i> environment. To include
    the <i>table</i> environment, use the options <b><u>pre</u></b><b>table(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b> and <b><u>post</u></b><b>table(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b>
<p>
    <b><u>pre</u></b><b>table(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b> Include here LaTeX code you would like to have in the
    tex-file before the <i>tabular</i> environment. This option is only available
    when the option <b><u>tex</u></b><b>(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b> is specified.
<p>
    <b><u>post</u></b><b>table(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b> Include here LaTeX code you would like to have in the
    tex-file after the <i>tabular</i> environment. This option is only available
    when the option <b><u>tex</u></b><b>(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b> is specified.
<p>
    <b>force</b> By default, the program stops working when more than
    10 categories are detected, since this will lead to
    extremely large tables and is most likely due to the use of
    a continuous variable as grouping variable. If you want to
    perform the analysis with more than the generally admitted
    10 categories, use the option force, which elimiates this
    limit.
<p>
<b><u>Output</u></b>
    Besides the screen output and the export to LaTeX,
    ttesttable generates three matrices which can be accessed
    through "return list":
<p>
        r(p) : matrix of p-values
<p>
        r(t) : matrix of t statistics
<p>
        r(diff) : matrix of differences in means
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Example</u></b>
<p>
    <b>ttesttable</b> score country, tex(myfile)
    pre("\begin{table}[!ht]\centering") post("\caption{Cross
    table of differences in mean by group\end{table}"
<p>
    This example will provide a matrix containing the
    differences in the average scores across countries and
    performs a T-test for any combination of groups. The stars
    will indicate if the difference is significantly different
    from zero. The table will be exported to the file <i>myfile.tex</i>
    and include the <i>table</i> environment as defined by the options
    <b>pre()</b> and <b>post()</b>
