Create a sequential Stata time variable from a starting time
------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^tsmktim^ newtimevar , ^s^tart(date_literal) [ ^seq^uence(varname) ^i^(
&gt; varname)]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
Creates a Stata time variable, newtimevar, with an appropriate format for
yearly, twice yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly or daily data, and executes
^tsset^ to use that variable as the time specifier.  Note that the data
must be ordered by time before issuing ^tsmktim^.
<p>
If ^sequence()^ is not specified, the data are assumed to have no gaps and are
sequential in the periodicity of ^date_literal^.  That is to say, one quarter
after another or one month after another with no gaps.
<p>
If ^i()^ is specified, the data are assumed to be a panel with that variable as
the panel indicator (^iis^). The first observation of each panel unit is assume
&gt; d
to be dated ^start^ unless a ^sequence^ variable is specified.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^start^(^date_literal^) is required and specifies the starting date for the
    first observation in the dataset.  ^date_literal^ takes forms such as
    1964, 1999m1, 1960q1, 12jan1985, etc.  depending on whether the data is
    monthly, quarterly, daily, etc; see ^help tfcn^ for more on how to
    specify dates.
<p>
^sequence(^varname^)^ specifies that ^varname^ contains an integer variable
    that specifies the sequence of the observations.  This allows gaps to be
    specified for the time variable.  If the values of ^varname^ are not
    sequential, the resulting time variable will have gaps.  
    
    Note that the start date specified in ^start()^ is taken to be the date
    of the value of the ^sequence()^ variable in the first observation.  If
    that value is missing, then the date from ^start()^ is associated with a
    value of 1 for the ^sequence()^ variable.
    
^i(^varname^)^ specifies that ^varname^ contains a variable indicating units of
    a panel. ^varname^ must be a valid argument for, e.g., ^iis^. ^tsmktim^ wil
&gt; l
    then create the time variable and ^tsset^ by both the panel variable and ti
&gt; me
    variable.

Examples
--------
<p>
    Assume the following data
<p>
             x
            --
            44
            21
            15
            77
            .
            .
            .
<p>
    
    Typing
<p>
        ^. tsmktim mytime, start(1977q2)^
<p>
    will produce
<p>
             x   mytime
            --   ------
            44   1977q2
            21   1977q3
            15   1977q4
            77   1978q1
            .      .
            .      .
            .      .
<p>
    Similarly, 
<p>
        ^. tsmktim mytime, start(29dec1948)^
<p>
    will produce
<p>
<p>
             x      mytime
            --   ---------
            44   29dec1948
            21   30dec1948
            15   31dec1948
            77   01jan1949
            .      .
            .      .
            .      .
<p>
<p>
     With a sequence variable, 
<p>
        ^. tsmktim mytime, start(29dec1948) sequence(myseq)^
<p>
     will produce
<p>
             x   myseq      mytime
            --   -----   ---------
            44      10   29dec1948
            21      12   31dec1948
            15      13   01jan1949
            77      23   11jan1949
