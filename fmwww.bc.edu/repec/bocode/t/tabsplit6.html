Tabulate and generate string variables split into parts
-------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^tabsplit6^ strvar [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [, ^g^enerate^(^stub^)^
    ^gmax(^#^) h^eader^(^headerstr^) p^unct^(^punctchars^) s^ort ] 
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^tabsplit6^ tabulates frequencies of occurrence of the parts of a string
variable.
<p>
By default, the parts of a string are separated by spaces. The parts of
^"1 2 3"^ are thus ^"1"^, ^"2"^ and ^"3"^.
<p>
Optionally, alternative punctuation characters may be specified. The
parts of ^"1,2,3"^ with ^p(,)^ are, again, ^"1"^, ^"2"^ and ^"3"^. The
parts of ^"1 2 3"^ with ^p(,)^ are just the single part ^"1 2 3"^.
<p>
Note: this is a now superseded version of ^tabsplit^, written for Stata 6. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^tabsplit^. 
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
Suppose data are gathered on modes of transport used in the journey 
to work. In addition to values of ^car^, ^cycle^, ^foot^, and so 
forth, there may be multiple values such as ^car train tube foot^ for 
people who use two or more modes. Within the limit of 80 characters such 
single or multiple values may be stored as string variables. It may then 
be desired, for example, to count the individual modes used. ^tabsplit6^ is 
designed for this special problem. (Naturally an alternative data structure 
would be a set of indicator variables.) 
<p>
Leading and trailing spaces are ignored by ^tabsplit6^. Thus, string
values that equal one or more spaces are treated just as if they were
missing. Also with ^" 1,  2,   3"^ and ^p(,)^ the parts are ^"1"^, ^"2"^
and ^"3"^.
<p>
The idea of a part generalises Stata's concept of a word:
<p>
    ^. local words "Stata for data analysis"^
    ^. local word4 : word 4 of `words'^
<p>
puts the string ^"analysis"^ in local macro ^word4^.
<p>
To get just the first part of a string, there is another way,
exemplified here with space ^" "^ as a separator, but it works with any
other single separator:
<p>
    .^ gen str1 Make = ""^
    .^ replace Make = substr(make,1,index(make," ")-1)^
    .^ replace Make = make if Make == ""^
<p>
This way allows you to be ignorant about the length of string needed:
with ^replace^, Stata automatically changes the variable type if needed.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^generate(^stub^)^ generates new string variables stub^1^, stub^2^, etc.
    containing parts 1, 2, etc. of strvar. The number of new variables
    created will be (at most) the maximum number of parts present in a
    string value. With ^g(mystr)^ and strings
<p>
    ^"Stata for data analysis"^
    ^"soap for washing"^
<p>
    4 variables will be created: ^mystr1^ to ^mystr4^. ^mystr1[1]^ will
    be ^"Stata"^ and ^mystr2[4]^ will be empty ^""^.
<p>
^gmax(^#^)^ specifies that only stub^1^ to stub# should be generated. A
    number greater than the maximum number of parts will have no effect.
<p>
^header(^headerstr^)^ specifies a heading for the table. Default ^Parts^.
<p>
^punct(^punctchars^)^ specifies alternative punctuation characters
    deemed to separate parts. One or more characters may be specified.
    If ^punct( )^ is not specified, spaces are used. (Note that
    attempting to specify just a space will result in a syntax error.)
<p>
    If you wish to use the space ^" "^ as well as other non-space
    characters, specify it within quotation marks: e.g. ^p(" ,")^.
<p>
    As a special case, ^punct(no)^ indicates no punctuation characters.
    Strings will be split into separate characters other than spaces.
<p>
^sort^ indicates that ^tabsort^ rather than ^tabulate^ will be used to
    produce a table with frequencies sorted from highest to lowest. This
    option may only be used if ^tabsort^ has been installed.
