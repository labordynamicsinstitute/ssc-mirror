Table of frequencies as horizontal plot

Description
-----------
<p>
^tabhplot^ is a driver for ^hplot^ that produces a horizontal plot of
the frequencies of the distinct values of either one or two categorical
variables.
<p>
With one variable, its values define the `rows' of the plot.
<p>
With two variables, their values define the `rows' and `columns' of the
plot, best explained by example.
<p>
Given the following frequencies (from ^tab for rep78^)

<p>
in the default `long' form  given by ^tabhplot for rep78^, data lines are in th
&gt; e
following order:
<p>
Domestic  1          2
          2          8
          3         27
          4          9
          5          2
Foreign   3          3
          4          9
          5          9
<p>
while in the `wide' form given by ^tabhbar for rep78, wide^, lines
carry symbols for:
<p>
Domestic       2 2 8 9 27
Foreign        3 9 9
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^fsort^ specifies that lines are to be sorted by frequency, the line with
     the lowest frequency being placed at the top of the chart. This
     applies only with one variable.
<p>
^rfsort^ specifies that lines are to be sorted by frequency, the line with
     the highest frequency being placed at the top of the chart. This
     applies only with one variable.
<p>
^zero^ specifies that combinations with frequency zero are wanted.
<p>
^rowpc^, ^rowpr^, ^rowfr^, ^colpc^, ^colpr^, ^colfr^ scale frequencies
     to be percents, adding to 100, or proportions (fractions), adding to 1,
     of the total of the row or column variable. ^rowpr^ and ^rowfr^
     are equivalent, as are ^colpr^ and ^colfr^. The ^col^*
     options are useful only when two variables are plotted.
<p>
^wide^ gives a stacked form of the plot. See above.
<p>
hplot_options are options of ^hplot^.
