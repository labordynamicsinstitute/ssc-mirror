Transformations: an introduction
.-
<p>
^Transformation^ is the replacement of a variable by a function of that
variable: for example, replacing a variable x by the square root of x or
the logarithm of x. It is very common in data analysis.

Reasons for using transformations
---------------------------------
<p>
There are many reasons for transformation. The list here is not
comprehensive.
<p>
1. Convenience
2. Reducing skewness
3. Equal spreads
4. Linear relationships
5. Additive relationships
<p>
If you are looking at just one variable, 1, 2 and 3 are relevant, while
if you are looking at two or more variables, 4 and 5 are more important.
However, transformations that achieve 4 and 5 very often achieve 2 and
3.
<p>
1. ^Convenience^ A transformed scale may be as natural as the original
scale and more convenient for a specific purpose (e.g. percentages
rather than original data, sines rather than degrees).
<p>
One important example is ^standardisation^, whereby values are adjusted
for differing level and spread. In general
<p>
                       value - level
 standardised value =  -------------.
                          spread
<p>
Standardised values have level 0 and spread 1 and have no units: hence
standardisation is useful for comparing variables expressed in different
units. Most commonly a ^standard score^ is calculated as
<p>
                       x - mean of x
                  z =  -------------.
                          sd of x
<p>
Standardisation makes no difference to the shape of a distribution.
<p>
2. ^Reducing skewness^ A transformation may be used to reduce skewness.
A distribution that is symmetric or nearly so is often easier to handle
and interpret than a skewed distribution.
<p>
To reduce right skewness, take roots or logarithms or reciprocals (roots
are weakest). This is the commonest problem in practice.
<p>
To reduce left skewness, take squares or cubes or higher powers.
<p>
3. ^Equal spreads^ A transformation may be used to produce approximately
equal spreads, despite marked variations in level, which again makes
data easier to handle and interpret. Each data set or subset having
about the same spread or variability is a condition called
^homoscedasticity^: its opposite is called ^heteroscedasticity^. (The
spelling ^-sked-^ rather than ^-sced-^ is also used.)
<p>
4.  ^Linear relationships^ When looking at relationships between
variables, it is often far easier to think about patterns that are
approximately linear than about patterns that are highly curved. This is
vitally important when using linear regression, which amounts to fitting
such patterns to data. (In Stata, @regress@ is the basic command for
regression.)
<p>
For example, a plot of logarithms of a series of values against time has
the property that periods with ^constant rates of change^ (growth or
decline) plot as straight lines.
<p>
5. ^Additive relationships^ Relationships are often easier to analyse
when additive rather than (say) multiplicative. So
<p>
                  y = a + bx
<p>
in which two terms a and bx are added is easier to deal with than
<p>
                        b
                  y = ax
<p>
                          b
in which two terms a and x  are multiplied. ^Additivity^ is a vital
issue in ^analysis of variance^ (in Stata, @anova@, @oneway@, etc.).
<p>
In practice, a transformation often works, serendipitously, to do
several of these at once, particularly to reduce skewness, to produce
nearly equal spreads and to produce a nearly linear or additive
relationship.
<p>
Review of most common transformations
-------------------------------------
<p>
The most useful transformations in introductory data analysis are
<p>
the ^reciprocal^ x to 1/x and the ^negative reciprocal^ x to -1/x. This
is a very strong transformation with a drastic effect on distribution
shape. It can not be applied to zero values. Although it can be applied
to negative values, it is not useful unless all values are positive. The
reciprocal of a ratio may often be interpreted as easily as the ratio
itself: e.g.
<p>
population density (people per unit area) becomes area per
person
<p>
persons per doctor becomes doctors per person
<p>
rates of erosion become time to erode a unit depth.
<p>
(In practice, we might want to multiply or divide the results of taking
the reciprocal by some constant, such as 1000 or 10000, to get numbers
that are easy to manage, but that itself has no effect on skewness or
linearity.)
<p>
The reciprocal reverses order among values of the same sign: largest
becomes smallest, etc. The negative reciprocal preserves order among
values of the same sign.
<p>
the ^logarithm^ x to log base 10 of x OR
              x to log base e of x (ln x) OR
              x to log base 2 of x.
This is a strong transformation with a major effect on distribution
shape. It is commonly used for reducing right skewness and is often
appropriate for measured variables. It can not be applied to zero or
negative values. One unit on a logarithmic scale means a multiplication
by the base of logarithms being used. Exponential growth or decline
<p>
                        bx
                  y = ae
<p>
is made linear by
<p>
               ln y = ln a + bx
<p>
so that the response variable y should be logged. (Here e is a special
number, approximately 2.71828, that is the base of natural logarithms.)
<p>
An aside on this ^exponential growth or decline^ equation: put x = 0,
and
<p>
                        0
                 y  = ae  = a,
<p>
so a is the amount or count when x = 0. If a and b &gt; 0, then y grows at
a faster and faster rate (e.g. compound interest or unchecked population
growth), whereas if a &gt; 0 and b &lt; 0, y declines at a slower and slower
rate (e.g. radioactive decay).
<p>
Power functions
<p>
                        b
                  y = ax
<p>
are made linear by
<p>
              log y = log a + b log x
<p>
so that both variables y and x should be logged.
<p>
An aside on such ^power functions^: put x = 0, and for b &gt; 0,
<p>
                        b
                 y  = ax  = 0,
<p>
so the power function for positive b goes through the origin, which
often makes physical or biological or economic sense. Think: does zero
for x imply zero for y? This kind of power function is a shape
that fits many data sets rather well.
<p>
Consider ratios
<p>
                 y  = p / q
<p>
where p and q are both positive in practice. Examples are
<p>
                 males / females
<p>
                 dependants / workers
<p>
                 downstream length / downvalley length
<p>
then y is somewhere between 0 and infinity, or in the last case, between
1 and infinity. If p = q, then y = 1. Such definitions often lead to
skewed data, because there is a definite lower limit and no definite
upper limit. The logarithm, however, namely
<p>
              log y = log p / q = log p - log q,
<p>
is somewhere between -infinity and infinity and p = q means that log y =
0. Hence the logarithm of such a ratio is likely to be more
symmetrically distributed.
<p>
the ^cube root^ x to x^^(1/3). This is a fairly strong transformation
with a substantial effect on distribution shape: it is weaker than the
logarithm. It is also used for reducing right skewness, and has the
advantage that it can be applied to zero values. Note that the cube root
of a volume has the units of a length. It is commonly applied to
rainfall data.
<p>
the ^square root^ x to x^^(1/2) = sqrt(x). This is a transformation with
a moderate effect on distribution shape: it is weaker than the logarithm
and the cube root. It is also used for reducing right skewness, and also
has the advantage that it can be applied to zero values. Note that the
square root of an area has the units of a length. It is commonly applied
to counted data, especially if the values are mostly rather small.
<p>
the ^square^ x to x^^2. This transformation has a moderate effect on
distribution shape and it could be used to reduce left skewness. In
practice, the main reason for using it is to fit a response by a
quadratic function y = a + b x + c x^^2. Quadratics have a turning
point, either a maximum or a minimum, although the turning point in a
function fitted to data might be far beyond the limits of the
observations. The distance of a body from an origin is a quadratic if
that body is moving under constant acceleration, which gives a very
clear physical justification for using a quadratic. Otherwise quadratics
are typically used solely because they can mimic a relationship within
the data region. Outside that region they may behave very poorly,
because they take on arbitarily large values for extreme values of x,
and unless the intercept a is constrained to be 0, they may behave
unrealistically close to the origin.
<p>
Squaring usually makes sense only if the variable concerned is zero or
positive, given that (-x)^^2 and x^^2 are identical.
<p>
The main criterion in choosing a transformation is: what works with the
data? As examples above indicate, it is important to consider as well
two questions.
<p>
- What makes physical (biological, economic, whatever) sense, for
  example in terms of limiting behaviour as values get very small or
  very large? This question often leads to the use of logarithms.
<p>
- Can we keep dimensions and units simple and convenient? If possible,
  we prefer measurement scales that are easy to think about. The cube
  root of a volume and the square root of an area both have the
  dimensions of length, so far from complicating matters, such
  transformations may simplify them. Reciprocals usually have simple
  units, as mentioned earlier. Often, however, somewhat complicated
  units are a sacrifice that has to be made.
<p>
Transformations for proportions and percents (more advanced)
------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
Data that are proportions (between 0 and 1) or percents (between 0 and
100) often benefit from special transformations. The most common is the
^logit^ (or logistic) transformation, which is
<p>
            logit p = log (p / (1 - p)) for proportions
<p>
         OR logit p = log (p / (100 - p)) for percents
<p>
where p is a proportion or percent.
<p>
This transformation treats very small and very large values
symmetrically, pulling out the tails and pulling in the middle around
0.5 or 50%. The plot of p against logit p is thus a flattened S-shape.
Strictly logit p cannot be determined for the extreme values of 0 and 1
(100%): if they occur in data, there needs to be some adjustment.
<p>
One justification for this logit transformation might be sketched in
terms of a diffusion process such as the spread of literacy. The push
from zero to a few percent might take a fair time; once literacy starts
spreading its increase becomes more rapid and then in turn slows; and
finally the last few percent may be very slow in converting to literacy,
as we are left with the isolated and the awkward, who are the slowest to
pick up any new thing. The resulting curve is thus a flattened S-shape
against time, which in turn is made more nearly linear by taking logits
of literacy. More formally, the same idea might be justified by
imagining that adoption (infection, whatever) is proportional to the
number of contacts between those who do and those who do not, which will
rise and then fall quadratically. More generally, there are many
relationships in which predicted values cannot logically be less than 0
or more than 1 (100%). Using logits is one way of ensuring this:
otherwise models may produce absurd predictions.
<p>
The logit (looking only at the case of proportions)
<p>
            logit p = log (p / (1 - p))
<p>
can be rewritten
<p>
            logit p = log p  - log (1 - p)
<p>
and in this form can be seen as a member of a set of ^folded^
^transformations^
<p>
     transform of p = something done to p -
                          something done to (1 - p).
<p>
This way of writing it brings out the symmetrical way in which very high
and very low values are treated. (If p is small, 1 - p is large, and
vice versa.) The logit is occasionally called the ^folded log^. The
simplest other such transformation is the ^folded root^ (that means
square root)
<p>
   folded root of p = root of p  - root of (1 - p)
<p>
As with square roots and logarithms generally, the folded root has the
advantage that it can be applied without adjustment to data values of 0
and 1 (100%). The folded root is a weaker transformation than the logit.
In practice it is used far less frequently.
<p>
Two other transformations for proportions and percents met in the older
literature (and still used occasionally) are the ^angular^ and the
^probit^. The angular is
<p>
            arcsin(root of p):
<p>
that is, the angle whose sine is the square root of p. In practice, it
behaves very like
<p>
             0.41          0.41
            p     - (1 - p)    ,
<p>
which in turn is close to
<p>
             0.5          0.5
            p    - (1 - p)   ,
<p>
which is another way of writing the folded root. The probit is a
transformation with a mathematical connection to the normal (Gaussian)
distribution, which is not only very similar in behaviour to the logit,
but also more awkward to work with. As a result, it is now rarely seen
in any but more advanced applications, where it retains some advantages.
<p>
Psychological comments -- for the puzzled
-----------------------------------------
<p>
The main motive for transformation is greater ease of description.
Although transformed scales may seem less natural, this is largely a
psychological objection. Greater experience with transformation tends to
reduce this feeling, simply because transformation so often works so
well. In fact, many familiar measured scales are really transformed
scales: decibels, pH and the Richter scale of earthquake magnitude are
all logarithmic.
<p>
Often it helps to transform results back again, using the reverse or
^inverse^ transformation:
<p>
    reciprocal             also reciprocal
<p>
    t = 1 / x              x = 1 / t
<p>
    logarithm base 10      10 to the power
<p>
                                 t
    t = log  x             x = 10
           10
<p>
    logarithm base e       e to the power
<p>
                                t
    t = log x = ln x       x = e
           e
<p>
    logarithm base 2       2 to the power
<p>
                                t
    t = log x              x = 2
           2
<p>
    cube root              cube
<p>
         1/3                    3
    t = x                  x = t
<p>
    square root            square
<p>
         1/2                    2
    t = x                  x = t
<p>
<p>
How to do transformations in Stata
----------------------------------
<p>
Basic first steps:
<p>
- Draw a graph of the data to see how far patterns in data match the
  simplest ideal patterns. Try @graph@ or @dotplot@.
<p>
- See what range the data cover. Transformations will have little effect
  if the range is small.
<p>
- Think carefully about data sets including zero or negative values.
  Some transformations are not defined mathematically for some values
  (see above), and often they make little or no scientific sense. For
  example, I would never transform temperatures in degrees Celsius or
  Fahrenheit for these reasons (unless to Kelvin).
<p>
Standard scores (mean 0 and sd 1) in a new variable are obtained by
<p>
    . ^egen stdpopi = std(popi)^
<p>
whereas the basic transformations can all be put in new variables by
@generate@:
<p>
    . ^gen recener = 1/energy^
    . ^gen logeener = ln(energy)^
    . ^gen l10ener = log10(energy)^
    . ^gen curtener = energy^^(1/3)^
    . ^gen sqrtener = sqrt(energy)^
    . ^gen sqener = energy^^2^
<p>
    . ^gen logitp = log(p/(1-p))^          if p is a proportion
    . ^gen logitp = log(p/(100-p))^        if p is a percent
    . ^gen frootp = sqrt(p) - sqrt(1-p)^   if p is a proportion
    . ^gen frootp = sqrt(p) - sqrt(100-p)^ if p is a percent
<p>
Note any messages about missing values carefully: unless you had missing
values in the original variable, they indicate an attempt to apply a
transformation when it is not defined. (Do you have zero or negative
values, for example?)
<p>
It is not always necessary to create a transformed variable before
working with it. In particular, @graph@ allows the option ^log^ when
producing a histogram and the options ^xlog^ and ^ylog^ when drawing
a (twoway) scatter plot. The last is very useful because the graph is
labelled using the original values, but it does not leave behind a
log-transformed variable in memory.
