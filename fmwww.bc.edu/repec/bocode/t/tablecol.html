<p>
rowvar, colvar, and supercolvar may be numeric or string variables.
<p>
Elements of clist may only be ^freq^; ^contents(freq)^ is assumed if ^contents(
&gt; )^ 
is not specified. Specify ^nofreq^ to suppress frequencies.
<p>
^fweight^s, ^pweight^s, ^aweight^s, and ^iweight^s are allowed; see help @weigh
&gt; ts@.

Description
-----------
<p>
^tablecol^ is a wrapper program for ^table^ which adds column percentages 
        to the output.  Essentially this provides the functionality of the 
        ^column^ option of the ^tabulate^ command, along with the ability to 
        specify supercolumns in table.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^colpct^ specifies that column percentages are to be displayed.
<p>
^rowpct^ specifies that row percentages are to be displayed.
<p>
^nofreq^ suppresses display of cell frequencies.
<p>
^contents(^clist^)^ is assumed to be ^contents(freq)^ if ^contents()^ is not sp
&gt; ecified.
    ^contents(freq)^ is the only valid use for this option.
<p>
^overall^ indicates that column percentages are to be calculated in terms
        of the table as a whole. By default, percentages are calculated within
        super-rows. If by(varlist) is not specified, this option has no effect.
<p>
<p>
All other options are the same as for ^table^. See help @table@.
