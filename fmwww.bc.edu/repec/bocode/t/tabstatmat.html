<b><u>Save matrices saved by tabstat to single named matrix</u></b>
<p>
        <b>tabstatmat</b> <i>matname</i> [ <b>,</b> <b><u>not</u></b><b>otal</b> <b><u>s</u></b><b>afe</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>tabstatmat</b> picks up matrices saved after tabstat.  These matrices will
    have names <b>r(Stat1)</b>, etc., together with their rownames saved as
    <b>r(name1)</b>, etc., and/or <b>r(StatTot)</b> or <b>r(StatTotal)</b>.  These matrices are
    combined and put them in the single named matrix <i>matname</i>.  If <i>matname</i>
    already exists, it will be overwritten unless option <b>safe</b> is specified;
    in this case, an error message will be issued.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    Note that not all requests to <b>tabstat</b> produce output in suitable form. In
    particular, a call that requests multiple statistics for multiple groups
    and multiple variables is not suitable. <b>tabstatmat</b> cannot be smart about
    detecting such calls and labelling rows or columns correctly. <b>tabstat</b>
    does not save all the necessary information in row and column names and
    composite row or column names such as "Foreign N" would be illegal in any
    case.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>nototal</b> suppresses the picking up of marginal totals.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. sysuse auto, clear</b>
    <b>. tabstat mpg, by(rep78) s(n mean sd) save</b>
    <b>. tabstatmat mpgstat</b>
    <b>. tabstatmat mpgstat, nototal</b>

    The first seven versions of<b> tabstatmat</b> were written by Nicholas J. Cox,
    Durham University.  The problem was suggested by Friedrich Huebler, who
    also advised of problems arising when only <b>r(StatTot)</b> is <b>save</b>d by
    <b>tabstat</b>. Lucy Chung advised that a previous version had been broken by a
    change to <b>tabstat</b> in Stata 9. Fredrik Wilhelmsson indicated a bug when
    totals are not saved and how to fix it. He also suggested the <b>nototal</b>
    option. Zurab Sajaia advised of a bug when matrices with many rows are
    requested and suggested how to fix it and made other useful suggestions.
