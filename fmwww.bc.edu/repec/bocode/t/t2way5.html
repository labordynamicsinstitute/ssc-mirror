Tukey's Two-Way Analysis by Medians
-----------------------------------

<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^t2way5^ uses Tukey's low-median polish technique to fit a two-way table
by medians.
<p>
^t2way5^ can produce both a tabular report and a graph.  Without
options, it produces only the tabular report.
<p>
graph_options are those options allowed with ^graph, twoway^, apart
    from ^symbol^, ^ttick^, ^rtick^, ^xlabel^ and ^ylabel^.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^t2way5^ is a translation to Stata 5.0 syntax and conventions of
^t2way^, issued on a Stata Support Disk in November 1990. It includes
some minor bug fixes and style changes. Stata Corp bear no
responsibility for this program.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^summari()^ indicates the dependent variable and is a required option.
<p>
^graph^ produces a residual graph showing the size and sign of the
    residuals plotted with an indication of the difference between the
    row and column fits on the horizontal axis and the fitted value on
    the vertical axis.
<p>
^quietly^ suppresses the tabular report.  This is typically used in
    combination with ^graph^ to obtain only the graph.
<p>
^gen( )^ adds three new variables to your data:  the row fit, column
    fit, and grand median fit.  This option resorts your data.
