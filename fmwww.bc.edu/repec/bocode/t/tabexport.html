<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>tabexport</b> exports as tables to text files various arrays of summary
    statistics which could be created by using collapse. By default outsheet
    is used, but optionally outfile may be specified.  The results are also
    <b>list</b>ed to provide a check on what is produced.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>statistics()</b> is a required option. One or more statistic names as
        specified in the help for collapse should be used.  Note that each
        statistic will be calculated for each variable:  <b>collapse</b> itself is
        not so restrictive.
<p>
    <b>format()</b> specifies one or more numeric formats controlling the detail of
        each statistic produced. The sequence of formats is that of the
        sequence of statistics. Thus with <b>s(count mean) f(%9.0f %9.1f)</b> counts
        will be shown with format %9.0f and means with format %9.1f. If fewer
        formats are specified than there are statistics, the last-specified
        format will be repeated for all remaining statistics. Thus with
        <b>s(count mean sd) f(%9.0f %9.1f)</b> counts will be shown with format
        %9.0f and means and sds with format %9.1f.  See help on format.
<p>
    <b>list()</b> specifies options of list to tune the output listing.
<p>
    <b>by(</b><i>byvarlist</i><b>)</b> and <b>cw</b> are the corresponding options of collapse.
<p>
    <b>total</b> applies whenever <b>by()</b> is also specified and specifies that results
        should be appended for all of the observations specified. Such
        results will be listed separately, as a reflection of the production
        process, but they will be combined in the resulting file.
<p>
    <b>noreshape</b> specifies that files produced should have a wide data
        structure, with many columns (variables).  The default is that they
        should be <b>reshape</b>d to have a long data structure, with fewer columns.
<p>
    <b>variableorder</b> may be specified with <b>noreshape</b>. The default of <b>noreshape</b>
        is that of collapse: the variable order is by statistic, then by
        original variable. <b>variableorder</b> reverses this: the variable order is
        by original variable, then by statistic.
<p>
    <b>outfile</b> specifies that outfile should be used to export files. The
        default is to use outsheet.
<p>
    <i>out_options</i> are options of <b>outsheet</b> or (if the <b>outfile</b> option is
        specified) of <b>outfile</b>.  By default, <b>noquote</b> is specified.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. sysuse auto, clear</b>
    <b>. tabexport turn trunk length using results.txt, s(mean sd) by(foreign)</b>
    <b>. tabexport turn trunk length using results.txt, s(mean sd) by(foreign)</b>
        <b>total replace</b>
    <b>. tabexport turn trunk length using results.txt, s(mean sd) by(foreign)</b>
        <b>total replace format(%9.1f)</b>
    <b>. type results.txt</b>

    Raymond Guiteras suggested this problem. Kit Baum provided some helpful
    field testing, identified an ordering problem and suggested the <b>format()</b>
    option. Fred Wolfe suggested adding a handle for <b>list</b> and identified
    another ordering problem.
