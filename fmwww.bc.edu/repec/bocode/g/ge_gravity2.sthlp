{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ge_gravity2} solves and simulates a gravity model with a positive supply elasticity, as decribed in the article by Campos, Reggio, and Timini (2024).
This new command can be used to simulate any model within the universal gravity framework defined by Allen et al (2020).
The {cmd:ge_gravity2} command extends a pre-existing command with the name {cmd:ge_gravity} (Baier et al 2019; Zylkin, 2019).  


{title:Required variables, settings, and options}

{dlgtab: Required variables}

{phang}
{it: exp_id} specifies the variable that identifies the location of origin, for example ISO codes or names of countries. This variable can be a string variable or numeric. This variable cannot contain missing values.

{phang}
{it: imp_id} specifies the variable that identifies the location of destination, for example ISO codes or names of countries. This variable a string variable or numeric. This variable cannot contain missing values.

{phang}
{it: flows} contains bilateral trade flows. This variable contains the flow from the location identified as {it: exp_id} to the location identified as {it: imp_id}. This variable cannot contain missing values, but can contain zeros.

{phang}
{it: partial} contains the "partial" estimate of the effect, typically obtained as a coefficient from a prior gravity estimation. This variable cannot contain missing values.


{dlgtab: Elasticities}

{phang}
{opt theta(#)} sets the trade elasticity, which must be strictly positive.

{phang}
{opt psi(#)} sets the aggregate supply elasticity, which must be nonnegative. If the option {cmd:psi()} is not specified, then the default is {opt psi(0)}.


{dlgtab: New variables (universal gravity)}

{phang}
{opt gen_X(varname)} generates counterfactual trade flows and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_rp(varname)} generates the change in real prices (p_hat/P_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_y(varname)} generates the change in income (Y_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_x(varname)} generates the change in trade flows (X_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_p(varname)} generates the change in output prices (p_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_P(varname)} generates the change in price indices (P_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{dlgtab: New variables (prototypical model)}

{phang}
{opt gen_w(varname)} generates the change in welfare (W_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_q(varname)} generates the change in output (Q_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_rw(varname)} generates the change in real wages (w_hat/P_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.

{phang}
{opt gen_nw(varname)} generates the change in nominal wages (w_hat in the model) and places the result in a new variable called {it:varname} or overwrites this variable if it already exists.


{dlgtab: Other options}

{phang}
{opt r:esults} prints a table with percent changes for exports, imports, total trade, domestic trade, output, and welfare.

{phang}
{opt uni:versal} solves the model with universal trade deficits and allows the user to set the option {opt xi_hat}.

{phang}
{opt mult:iplicative} solves the model for trade deficits that imply E_hat = Y_hat (for backward compatibility with the multiplicative option of the {cmd: ge_gravity} command).

{phang}
{opt c_hat(matrix)} changes supply shifters (c_hat in the model). Welfare will not be calculated if this option is used. This option may not be combined with the options {opt a_hat} or {opt l_hat}.
The default is that all elements of {opt c_hat} are set to one.

{phang}
{opt a_hat(matrix)} changes productivity (A_hat in the prototypical trade model). This option may not be combined with the option {opt c_hat}.
The default is that all elements of {opt a_hat} are set to one.

{phang}
{opt l_hat(matrix)} changes the labor force (L_hat in the prototypical trade model). This option may not be combined with the option {opt c_hat}.
The default is that all elements of {opt l_hat} are set to one.

{phang}
{opt xi_hat(matrix)} changes trade deficits (xi_hat in the model). This option must be used in combination with the {opt universal} option.
If the {opt universal} option is selected and the {opt xi_hat} option is not used, then the command defaults to setting all elements of xi_hat to one.

{phang}
{opt tol(#)} sets the tolerance level to verify convergence of the vector of output price changes. The tolerance level must be a strictly positive real number.
The default is {opt tol(1e-12)}

{phang}
{opt max_iter(#)} sets the maximum number of iterations to solve for the vector of output price changes. The maximum number of iterations must be a positive integer.
The default is {opt max_iter(1000000)}


{title:Remarks}

{p 4 4 2}
The data must be a square database (i.e., the number of exporters must be the same as the numbers importers and their identities must coincide).
The data set must contain a string of numeric variable that identifies exporters and an additional variable of the same kind to identify importers.
Bilateral trade values must be nonnegative.

{pstd}
The command allows the use of the {cmd:by} prefix. If data are not sorted, then it is necessary to use the prefix {cmd:bysort} instead of {cmd:by}. 

{pstd}
{cmd: ge_gravity2} is an e-class ado. To view the list of stored elements issue the command {cmd: ereturn list}.
If {cmd: ge_gravity2} is run with the {cmd:by} prefix, then only the elements {cmd:e(theta)} and {cmd:e(psi)} will be generated and stored.
