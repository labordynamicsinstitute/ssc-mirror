<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>gendist</b> generates Euclidean distances for a battery of spatial items,
    where variables in <i>varlist</i> contain the placement of different objects on
    the spatial scale and the variable specified in <b>respondent</b> contains the
    self-placement of the respondent on the same spatial scale. Distances
    between the respondent and each spatial item in the battery are placed in
    corresponding members of a new battery of items. Only one battery of
    items can be processed on a single invocation of <b>gendist</b>.
<p>
    The items in the new battery are given names derived from appending the
    names in <i>varlist</i> to the prefix established in option <b>dprefix</b> (default
    <i>d_</i>).
<p>
    If optioned by <b>missing</b>, <b>gendist</b> also generates a new battery of items
    with the prefix established in option <b>pprefix</b> (default <i>p_</i>) which is
    identical to the original battery but with missing values plugged by mean
    values. These mean values can be mean placements (e.g. of political
    parties on the left-right scale) by all respondents, mean placements by
    respondents who themselves have the same position as the placement, or
    mean placements by respondents themselves having a different position,
    depending on what is specified in option <b>missing</b>.
<p>
    Conventionally in published work the plugged value has been based on all
    placements. However, it might be thought that respondents having the same
    position would be more knowledgeable about the object concerned.
    Alternatively it might be thought that respondents having the same
    position might include individuals who were simply assuming that 'their'
    party had the same position as they did. Each of the <b>missing</b> options is
    defensible theoretically so the user should think carefully about which
    to employ. The default is not to plug the missing data, so that distances
    are generated only for valid cases.
<p>
    The <b>gendist</b> command can be issued before or after stacking. If issued
    after stacking, by default it treats each stack as a separate context to
    take into account along with any higher-level contexts. However, the
    <b>nostack</b> option can be employed to force <b>gendist</b> to ignore the
    stack-specific contexts.  In addition, this command can be employed with
    or without distinguishing between higher-level contexts, if any, (with or
    without the <b>contextvars</b> option) depending on what makes methodological
    sense.
    NOTE that it is unlikely to make methodological sense to employ <b>gendist</b>
    after stacking along with both the <b>nostack</b> and the <b>mean</b> options, since
    this would result in missing values being plugged with a mean that
    combined the values of what were (before stacking) several different
    variables.
<p>
    SPECIAL NOTE ON MULTIPLE BATTERIES. Gendist is only aware of the battery
    it is currently processing. Thus it cannot diagnose an error if that
    battery is of a different length than other batteries of items pertaining
    to the objects (eg political parties) being asked about. Yet stacked
    datasets (the type of datasets for which distances are wanted) absolutely
    require all batteries pertaining to the objects being stacked to contain
    the same number of items and have these items in the correct sequential
    order (<b>gendist</b> will produce stacks in the correct order, padded as needed
    with stacks that contain only missing values, if the numeric suffixes to
    all batteries of items are correct). In datasets derived from election
    studies is is quite common for some questions (eg about party locations
    on certain issues) to be asked only for a subset of the objects being
    investigated (eg parties). Moreover, questions relating to those objects
    may not always list them in the same order. If the user employs <b>tab1</b> or
    <b>gendummies</b> to generate a battery of dummy variables corresponding to
    questions that did not list all parties or listed them in a different
    order then not only may the number of items in the resulting battery be
    different from those in another battery but also the numeric suffixes
    generated by <b>tab1</b> or <b>gendummies</b> may refer to different objects in the
    case of items from the different batteries. One part of this problem is
    alleviated by the use of <b>gendummies</b> which generates dummy variable
    suffixes from the values actually found in the data, rather then
    numbering these sequentially as does <b>tab1</b>. But those values do need to be
    correct, which only the user can check.  See also the special note on
    multiple batteries in the help text for <b>genstacks</b>.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>respondent(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> (required) the variable containing the respondent's
        self-placement on the battery of items.
<p>
    <b>contextvars(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b> if present, variables whose combinations identify
        different electoral contexts (by default all cases are assumed to
        belong to the same context).
<p>
    <b>stackid(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> if specified, a variable identifying different "stacks",
        for which distances will be separately generated in the absence of
        the <b>nostack</b> option. The default is to use the "genstacks_stack"
        variable if the <b>gendist</b> command is issued after stacking.
<p>
    <b>nostack</b> if present, overrides the default behavior of treating each stack
        as a separate context (has no effect if data are not stacked).
<p>
    <b>missing(</b><i>mean|same|diff</i><b>)</b> if present, determines treatment of missing
        values for object placement variables (by default they remain
        missing).
        If <b>mean</b> is specified, missing values are replaced with the overall
        mean placement of that object, calculated on the whole sample.
        If <b>same</b> is specified, missing values are replaced with the mean
        placement of the object, calculated only among those respondents that
        placed themselves on the same position as the object.
        If <b>diff</b> is specified, missing values are replaced with the mean
        placement of the object, calculated only among those respondents who
        placed themselves on a different position than the object (see
        discussion under 'Description' above regarding choice between these
        options).
        When missing values are plugged, a set of p_<i>varlist</i> variables is
        generated, and the original variables are left unchanged (the p_
        prefix can be altered by use of the option <b>pprefix</b>).
        NOTE: More sophisticated imputation facilites are offered by <b>iimpute</b>.
<p>
    <b>round</b> if present, causes rounding of all plugged values to the closest
        integer.
<p>
    <b>dprefix(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> if present, provides a prefix for generated distance
        variables (default is "d_").
<p>
    <b>pprefix(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> if present, provides a prefix for generated mean-plugged
        placements (default is "p_").
<p>
    <b>mprefix(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> if present, provides a prefix for generated variables
        indicating for each case whether, before mean-plugging of an item in
        the battery, either the item placement or the respondent placement
        was missing for that case (default is "m_").
<p>
    <b>mcountname(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> if specified, name of a generated variable reporting
        original number of missing items (default is "_gendist_mc")
<p>
    <b>mpluggedcountname(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> if specified, name of a generated variable
        reporting number of missing items after mean-plugging, which could
        still be non-zero (even after all missing values on item positions
        have been plugged) if the respondent's own self-placement is missing
        (default is "_gendist_mpc")
<p>
    <b>replace</b> if specified, drops all party position and mean-plugged placement
        variables after the generation of distance measures
<p>
<b><u>Examples:</u></b>
<p>
    The following command generates distances on a left-right dimension,
    where party placements are in variables lrp1-lrp10, and R's
    self-placement is in lrresp; missing placements are replaced by simple
    mean-plugging, and then rounded to the nearest integer.
<p>
        <b>. gendist lrp1-lrp10, respondent(lrresp) missing(mean) round</b>
<p>
<b><u>Generated variables</u></b>
<p>
    <b>gendist</b> saves the following variables and variable sets:
<p>
      p_<i>var1</i> p_<i>var2</i> ... (or other prefix set by option <b>pprefix</b>)
                        a set of mean-plugged placement variables with names
                        p_var1, p_var2, etc., where the names var1, var2,
                        etc. match the original variable names. Those
                        variables are left unchanged.
      m_<i>var1</i> m_<i>var2</i> ... (or other prefix set by option <b>mprefix</b>)
                        a set of variables with names m_var1, m_var2, etc.,
                        where the names var1, var2, etc. match the original
                        variable names of the battery of items. These
                        variables indicate the original missingness of var1,
                        var2, etc., or of the corresponding placement of the
                        respondent on the scale concerned.
      d_<i>var1</i> d_<i>var2 ...</i> (or other prefix set by option <b>dprefix</b>)
                        a set of distances from the respondent to each
                        (mean-plugged if optioned) placement variable. These
                        distance variables are named d_var1, d_var2, etc.,
                        where the names var1, var2, etc. match the original
                        variable names. Those variables are left unchanged.
      _gendist_mc      a variable showing the original count of missing items
                        for each case.
      _gendist_mpc     a variable showing the count of remaining missing
                        items for each case after mean-plugging.
<p>
    NOTE that a subsequent invocation of <b>gendist</b> will replace <i>_gendist_mc</i> and
        <i>_gendist_mpc</i> with new counts of missing values for that invocation of
        <b>gendist</b>. So the user should save these values after issuing the
