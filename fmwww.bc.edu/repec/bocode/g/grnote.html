----------------------------
<p>
basic syntax:

Description
-----------
<p>
^grnote^ adds text and lines for annotating a stata graph just drawn.  
Text is positioned by the options y(#) and x(#) where values are 
given in the scale of the data.  A line extending from the text 
can be drawn by specifying its end point using the y2(#) and x2(#) 
options.  An arrow can be added to the end of the line using the ^arrow^
option.  Other options are available for fine-tuning the placement, 
size and pen # of the added elements.  Options are also available for 
accumulating multiple annotations on the same graph and for saving the 
resulting graph.  
<p>
Nearly all of the functionality of grnote is also available through 
^grnotem^, a dialog-driven interactive command that can be accessed
after graph or grnote by simply typing ^grnotem^.  ^Grnotem^ allows
for visual placement of multiple elements and will draw annotations 
saved by ^grnote^ through the ^keep^ option.  It can also generate 
an equivalent grnote command and put it in the Review window if 
desired.  ^Grnotem^ is mostly self-explanatory after learning about 
the features of ^grnote^ listed below.
<p>
<p>
Basic Options for ^grnote^
-------------------------
^y(^#^)^ and ^x(^#^)^ are required to draw anything.  They specify the y and 
    x coordinates where the text should be placed and/or the line should 
    begin.  Both y and x are to be specified in the scale of the data, unless
    the ^pixel^ option is selected.
<p>
^text(^string^)^ is the text message to be displayed on the graph.
<p>
^y2(^#^)^ and ^x2(^#^)^ specify the ending coordinates for a line to be 
    drawn.  The line is drawn from ^y^,^x^ to ^y2^,^x2^.  Actually, 
    small adjustments may be made to ^y^ and ^x^, depending on the 
    direction of the line and the placement options.  
<p>
^arrow^ specifies that an arrow should be drawn at the end of the line 
    pointing toward ^y2^,^x2^.
<p>
^saving(^filename^)^ saves the resulting graph in filename.gph.  The user 
    needs to ensure that the filename is valid and does not exist.  
    (^Grnotem^ will check and issue a message if it already exists)
<p>
^pixel^ specifies that coordinates are given in virtual pixels, not in 
    the scale of the data.  Virtual pixel coordinates range from 0,0
    in the upper left corner to 23062,32000 in the lower right corner. 
    This option allows one to draw annotations on Stata graphs that do 
    not provide information on axis scaling such as box plots and matrix 
    plots.  (^Grnotem^ automatically invokes pixel mode when needed)
<p>
Additional Options : Adding Multiple Elements
---------------------------------------------
<p>
^keep^ specifies that information about the text and lines drawn 
    should be saved in global macros so that multiple additions 
    can be drawn on the same graph.  ^keep^ should not be 
    specified until the desired results are achieved.  
<p>
^all^ specifies that all graph additions saved by prior ^keep^ commands 
    should be drawn, along with any current addition.  In ^grnotem^, ^all^
    is the default behavior, but can be unchecked.
<p>
^clear^ specifies that all information saved by ^keep^ should be cleared.
<p>
<p>
Additional Options : Fine Tuning 
--------------------------------
<p>
^talign(^left|center|right^)^ and ^tvalign(^top|center|bottom^)^ are options 
    that adjust the alignment of the text.  ^Talign^ specifies the 
    horizontal alignment and ^tvalign^ specifies the vertical alignment.  
    Defaults are to center text at ^x^ and align the bottom of text with ^y^.
<p>
^tsize(^%magnification^)^ allows the user to change the size of the text by 
    specifying a magnification percent, the default is 100 meaning 100% of 
    the default size.
<p>
^tpen(^#^)^, ^lpen(^#^)^, and ^apen(^#^)^ are options for specifying the pen to
&gt;  be 
    used for drawing the text, line and arrow respectively.  The default 
    pens are ^tpen^=1, ^lpen^=3, ^apen^=^lpen^.
<p>
^lalign(^left|center|right^)^ and ^lvalign(^top|center|bottom^)^ adjust the pos
&gt; ition 
    of the start of the line drawn relative to the text.  ^Lalign^ specifies th
&gt; e 
    horizontal position and ^lvalign^ specifies the vertical position. Defaults
&gt;  
    are chosen based on the angle of the line and position of the text. 
<p>
^xlnudge(^#^)^ and ^ylnudge(^#^)^ adjust the position of the start of the line.
    Values should be specified in virtual pixels.  This option is not 
    available in ^grnotem^, but lines can be placed anywhere by using 
    a blank text field.
<p>
^asize(^#^)^ allows the user to change the size of the arrow by specifying
    a magnification percent, the default is 100 meaning 100% of the default.
<p>
^aangle(^angle^)^ allows the user to specify the angle between the arrow lines 
    and the line, in radians.  The default is pi/6. 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^grnote^ must be issued after a graph command and is intended primarily
for use with scatterplots.  Attempts to annotate other types of plots 
(e.g., bar graphs) can produce unexpected results due to Stata's 
treatment of x axis scaling and the results returned by the graph 
command.  The ^pixel^ option can be useful on graphs where the
standard approach doesn't work well.  
<p>
The text and lines will extend beyond the data region of the graph 
if values outside the scales are specified. 
<p>
^grnotem^ is a powerful alternative because of the visual interaction
provided through the dialog box approach.
