<p>
<b><u>Generate an indicator variable, indicating which observations are at or after a</u></b>
<b><u>&gt;  given observation.</u></b>
<p>
        <b>gen_tail</b> <i>varname</i><b>, gen(</b><i>newvar</i><b>)</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>gen_tail</b> generates an indicator variable (valued 0 or 1), with values of
    1 corresponding to the "tail end" of a series of observations.  The tail
    starts at the first nonzero value (including missing) in <i>varname</i> and
    continues until the end of the dataset or by-group.
<p>
    Typically, <i>varname</i> is itself an indicator variable, though any numeric
    variable will suffice.
<p>
    <b>by</b> <i>...</i> <b>:</b> may be used with <b>gen_tail</b>.  Typically, you would use it with <b>by</b>
    and you would include a secondary by-variable or set of by-variables; see
    help by and the example, below.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Example</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. bysort personid (year): gen_tail incm_mis, gen(incm_mis_tail)</b>
<p>
    In such a usage, it is the user's responsibility to insure that the
    secondary by-variable(s) (<b>year</b>, in this case), in combination with the
    primary by-variable(s), establish a unique sort order.  Otherwise, you
    will not have meaningful or consistent results.
<p>
    A typical usage sequence would be as follows.
<p>
    <b>. gen byte incm_mis = mi(income)</b>
    <b>. bysort personid (year): gen_tail incm_mis, gen(incm_mis_tail)</b>
    <b>. logit</b><i> outcomevar ...</i> <b>income</b> <i>...</i><b>  if ~incm_mis_tail</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>gen_tail</b> was created for use with duration data, though it may be useful
    in other data-construction situations.  With duration data, it is used
    for creating variables that indicate censoring, where censoring begins at
    the first occurrence (within a spell) of a censoring event.  That is, a
    censoring event causes its own observation to be omitted, along with all
    subsequent observations within the spell.
