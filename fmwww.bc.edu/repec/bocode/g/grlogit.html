Plots logit of a variable by categories of another variable
----------------------------
<p>
    ^grlogit^ depvar indepvar [if] [, gropt(...) ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^grlogit^ plots the logit of one variable against categories of another variabl
&gt; e.
<p>
This may be of some use in the beginning of logistic regression modelling. You 
could use this program to confirm visually that there isn't a non-linear 
relationship of the logit of the dependent variable to the predictor variable. 
Thus, you could screen your explanatory variables during the univariate 
analysis  stage.
<p>
It is not for use in assessing incorrectly specified link functions in
multivariable models.
<p>
The logit of a variable x is defined as
       ^logit^(x) = x / (1-x)
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^gropt(...)^  specifies a string with options that are passed
along to the graph command.
<p>
<p>
Remarks 
-------
This program does not accept weights yet. It should be easily modified 
for this. Just fiddle around with the "table" statement.
<p>

Examples

    . ^grlogit^ response age
    . ^grlogit^ response age, gropt("xlab(15(10)70)")
