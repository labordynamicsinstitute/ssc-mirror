Fitting gamma distribution by moments and maximum likelihood
------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^gamma4^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [, ^s(^#^)^ ^t^ol^(^#^) l^og ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^gamma4^ works on a single variable. All non-missing values must be
positive. A two-parameter gamma distribution is fitted by the method of
moments (a closed-form calculation) and by the method of maximum
likelihood (ML) (an iterative calculation, which may occasionally be
rather slow).
<p>
The algorithm used for ML estimation of alpha was proposed by P.W.
Mielke. See Mielke and Johnson (1974) and Mielke (1976). The first
approximation is that suggested by Thom (1958).
<p>
It is assumed that the parameterisation is
1. shape parameter, here called alpha
2. scale parameter, same units as data, here called beta.
<p>
Some people work with a scale parameter which in these terms is 1/beta.
Yet others work with alpha and the mean, here called mu. Such people are
recommended to treat the saved values suitably.
<p>
Note: this is the original version of ^gamma^, written for Stata 4. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^gammafit^. 
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^log^ specifies that the results of each iteration should be displayed.
<p>
^s(^#^)^ controls the number of terms used within ^gamma4^ in a series
    approximation to the digamma function. The default is 100. This is a
    technical option and should not normally be changed. See Mielke
    (1976) for enlightenment.
<p>
^tol(^#^)^ controls the tolerance used within ^gamma4^ to control
    iteration. The default is 0.0000001. This is a technical option and
    should not normally be changed. See Mielke (1976) for enlightenment.
