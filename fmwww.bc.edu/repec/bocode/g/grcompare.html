For these programs to run well, you need to install SPost first as the grcompar
&gt; e commands use some low 
utility programs from SPost (search SPost) written for Stata 9 (spost9_ado).  W
&gt; hile installing SPost, 
you need to be aware that there could be variations across different versions. 
&gt; More recent versions of SPost may 
work well with grcompare, but the author of grcompare has not systematically te
&gt; sted yet.  You are encouraged to 
cite our work if you use this suite of commands in your own works:
