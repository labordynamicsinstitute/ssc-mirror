help for <b>gpreset</b>                                                 (Roger Newson)

<b><u>Reset preferences for a custom graphics scheme to their original values</u></b>
<p>
        <b>gpreset</b> <i>#</i>
<p>
where <i>#</i> is a number from 1 to 3, specifying one of the customized graphics
schemes <b>custom1</b> to <b>custom3</b>.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>gpreset</b> resets the preferences for a specified customized graphics scheme to
their original values as shipped with Stata. That is to say, <b>custom1</b> is set to
be the same as <b>blackbg</b>, <b>custom2</b> is set to be the same as <b>whitebg</b>, and <b>custom3</b>
is set to be the same as <b>monochrome</b>.  The user can therefore change the
preferences of scheme <b>custom</b><i>#</i> temporarily, and return them to their original
values afterwards. For further details on graphics preference schemes, see help
for gprefs.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
Stata provides six graphics schemes, of which three (<b>blackbg</b>, <b>whitebg</b> and
<b>monochrome</b>) are standard and cannot be modified by the user, and the other
three (<b>custom1</b>, <b>custom2</b> and <b>custom3</b>) are customizable and can be modified by
the user.  However, when shipped, <b>custom1</b> is identical to <b>blackbg</b>, <b>custom2</b> is
identical to <b>whitebg</b>, and <b>custom3</b> is identical to <b>monochrome</b>. This makes it
easy for users to create customized schemes similar to one of the standard
schemes, but different in a few details. <b>gpreset</b> allows the user to reset the
customized settings in a single command. It is probably a good idea for the
user to store frequently-used customized settings as sequences of gprefs
commands in ado-files, which can convert the original values of the preferences
of one of the customized schemes to the desired values. The user may also
include one or more <b>gpreset</b> commands in the file <b>profile.do</b>, so that every
Stata session starts with the customized schemes set to their original values;
see help for profile.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
The following example will reset the settings of the scheme <b>custom3</b> to their
original values, then set the thickness of pen 1 temporarily to 4, create a
plot, and finally reset the settings back to their original values again.
<p>
                . gpreset 3
                . gprefs set custom3 pen1_thick 4
                . gprefs query custom3
                . gprefs set window scheme custom3
                . gprefs set window update
                . grap mpg weight,s([foreign]) ylabel xlabel
                . gpreset 3
                . gprefs query custom3
