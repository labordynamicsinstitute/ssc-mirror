    <b>gphudak</b> is for use with time-series data.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before
    using <b>gphudak</b>; see help <b>tsset</b>.  <b>gphudak</b> supports the <b>by</b> prefix, which may
    be used to operate on each time series in a panel. Alternatively, the <b>if</b>
    qualifier may be used to specify a single time series in a panel.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>gphudak</b> computes the Geweke/Porter-Hudak (GPH, 1983) estimate of the long
    memory (fractional integration) parameter, <i>d</i>, of a timeseries. If a series
    exhibits long memory, it is neither stationary (I[0]) nor is it a unit root
    (I[1]) process; it is an I[{it:d] process, with <i>d</i> a real number. A series
    exhibiting long memory, or persistence, has an autocorrelation function
    that damps hyperbolically, more slowly than the geometric damping exhibited
    by 'short memory' (ARMA) processes. Thus, it may be predictable at long
    horizons. An excellent survey of long memory models--which originated in
    hydrology, and have been widely applied in economics and finance--is given
    by Baillie (1996).
<p>
    The GPH method uses nonparametric methods--a spectral regression
    estimator-- to evaluate <i>d</i> without explicit specification of the 'short
    memory' (ARMA) parameters of the series. The series is usually differenced
    so that the resulting <i>d</i> estimate will fall in the [-0.5, 0.5] interval.
<p>
    A choice must be made of the number of harmonic ordinates to be included in
    the spectral regression. The regression slope estimate is an estimate of
    the slope of the series' power spectrum in the vicinity of the zero
    frequency; if too few ordinates are included, the slope is calculated from
    a small sample. If too many are included, medium and high-frequency
    components of the spectrum will contaminate the estimate. A choice of
    root(T), or <b>power</b> = 0.5 is often employed. To evaluate the robustness of
    the GPH estimate, a range of power values (from 0.4 - 0.75) is commonly
    calculated as well.  <b>gphudak</b> uses the default power of 0.5. A list of
    powers may be given.
<p>
    The command displays the <i>d</i> estimate, number of ordinates, conventional
    standard error and P-value, as well as the asymptotic standard error.
    These values are returned in a matrix, <b>e(gph)</b>, formatted for display.
