<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
This command takes a log-linear model and draws an undirected graph, the nodes
are the variables in the model and edges between nodes represent a second order
interaction or higher.  The nodes are placed in a circle for ease of display so
may look cluttered with large amounts of nodes. It's main benefit is when used
in conjunction with the command <b>swblock</b> for displaying the inter-locus
relationships in a small genomic region. The log-linear model should be
specified by the syntax used in the commands <b>hapipf</b> or <b>ipf</b>.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b><u>no</u></b><b>legend</b> specifies that the legend for the edges is not displayed
<p>
<b><u>g</u></b><b>ap(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> specifies that an "invisible node" is inserted at the top of the
graph. This is handy when the variables in the log-linear model are ordered and
the "end" variables need to moved further apart.
<p>
<b><u>o</u></b><b>rder(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> specifies the order of the nodes. The default is to order nodes
around a circle in <b>reverse alphabetical</b> order.
<p>
<b><u>n</u></b><b>odelabel(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> specifies that the nodes are labelled with text rather than
variable names.
<p>
<b><u>lw</u></b><b>idth(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> specifies the relative thickness of the edges. The default integer
value is 1 and is best for looking at graphs within STATA. Integers greater
than 1 will give thicker edges.
<p>
<b><u>s</u></b><b>aving(</b><i>twoway_saving option</i><b>)</b> specifies that the graph is saved to disk. This
option takes the same syntax as the twoway saving_option.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
If the log-linear model was A*B. Then you would have 2 nodes A and B. The "*"
indicates that A and B interact or are related to each other and is represented
by a straight line connecting the two nodes.
<p>
e.g.   B ----- A
<p>
Click here gipf, model(A*B) gap(1) to see this graphic
<p>
The <b>gap</b> option means that an empty node is inserted at the top of the graph.
Without the <b>gap</b> option the graph would become
<p>
                B
                |
                |
                |
                |
                A
<p>
Click here gipf, m(A*B) to see this graphic.
<p>
As noticed from the above graphs the node B always appears to the left or upper
section. To reverse the node labels then use the <b>order</b> option.
<p>
e.g.  A ------ B
<p>
Click here gipf, m(A*B) order(B A) g(1) to see this graphic.
<p>
To label nodes differently to A and B you can assign labels by using the <b>nodela</b>
<b>&gt; bel</b> option
<p>
Click here gipf, m(A*B) o(B A) g(1) nodelabel("Var B" "Var A") to see this
graphic. Note that the node labels are in the order B then A, this was
specified by the <b>order</b> option.
<p>
For more complicated models there are usually more than 2 nodes for example the
graph for A*B+A*C looks like
<p>
                A               
               / \
              /   \
             /     \
            C       B
<p>
Click here gipf, m(A*B+A*C) to get the above graph you need to reorder the
nodes now click here gipf, m(A*B+A*C) o(B C A). Finally to add labels to this
graph click here gipf, m(A*B+A*C) o(B C A) n("Var B" "Var C" "Var A")
<p>
The final example is much more complicated and has higher order interactions
and this is much easier seen by clicking the last command
<p>
gipf, m(A*B*C*D+E*F*G+H*I+J)
<p>
<b><u>Use with swblock</u></b>
<p>
The command <b>swblock</b> is looking for the simplest model to describe a set of
genetic loci haplotype frequencies. Here the inclusion p-value is set to be
0.01 and there are 4 genetic markers.
<p>
.swblock l10_1-l13_2, p(0.01)
<p>
After this command has been run the "best" model is in the return class macro
called parsimod. Immediately after the above command the model can be displayed
as the above log-linear model graph by the following command
<p>
.gipf, m(`r(parsimod)')
