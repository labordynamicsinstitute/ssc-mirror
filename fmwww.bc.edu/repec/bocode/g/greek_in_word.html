    <b>Greek</b> and other Unicode characters in Word Rich Text Format (RTF) documents
<p>
    In Word RTF files, Greek letters and other Unicode characters can be
    included in the text as follows: a four digit decimal Unicode code
    preceded by "\u" and followed by "?".  Complete Unicode code tables are
    available at www.unicode.org/charts.  For use in Word RTF files, the
    hexadecimal codes in the tables must be converted to decimal numbers.
<p>
    For example, for the Greek lowercase character alpha, the hexadecimal
    Unicode code is 03B1, which is equivalent to 945 decimal, which we make
    into a four digit number by putting a "0" on the front, so the
    appropriate RTF code would be "\u0945?".
<p>
    The Unicode characters displayed in the Word file are limited only by
    which Unicode characters are included in the font being used.  For fonts
    like Times New Roman and Arial, a very wide range of characters are
    included.

    Complete Unicode code tables are available at www.unicode.org/charts.
    For use in Word RTF files, the hexadecimal codes in the tables must be
    converted to decimal numbers.  These can then be included in Word text as
    four digit decimals, preceded by \u and followed by ?.
