Plots proportion of one variable by categories of another
----------------------------
<p>
    ^grfreq^ outcome strata [if] [, outcom(integer) gropt(...) yaxis01 ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^grfreq^ plots proportions of one variable by categories of another.
<p>
For a binary variable, this could be the prevalence of a trait.
<p>
By default, the proportion of interest is that of the minimal value of
the outcome variable. The outcome of interest can be changed.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^gropt(...)^  specifies a string with options that are passed
along to the graph command.
<p>
^outcom(integer)^ specifies that the outcome of interest should be
a given value. The default is the minimal value of the outcome
variable.
<p>
^yaxis01^ scales the y-axis from 0 to 1 and gives axis ticks and labels.
<p>
<p>
Remarks 
-------
This program does not accept weights yet. It should be easily modified 
for this. Just fiddle around with the "table" statement.
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
    . ^grfreq^ response age
    . ^grfreq^ response age, gropt("xlab(15(10)70)")
    . ^grfreq^ response age, outcom(1)
