 ^geocode^, ^address^(varname) ^city^(varname) ^state^(varname) ^zip^(varname) 
&gt; [^fulladdr^(varname) ^yahoo^ ^both^]
 
 
Description
-----------
<p>
^geocode^ uses Google Maps and Yahoo! maps api to geocode 
addresses and  calculate latitude and longitude.
<p>
To use Yahoo! maps the option ^yahoo^ should be specified.
To use both Yahoo! and Google, the option ^both^ should
be specified. The default option is Google only. 
<p>
^geocode^ generates a unique id variable named ^geoid^.  
If the Google geocoder is specified, a variable named ^geocode^ 
is created which corresponds to a description of the geocoding 
accuracy, and ^geoscore^ which corresponds to a geographic level 
of accuracy. 
<p>
If the Yahoo! geooder is specified,  ^geocode^ generates a 
variable named ^ygeocode^ which corresponds to a description of 
the geocoding accuracy, and ^geoscore^ which corresponds to a 
geographic level of accuracy.
