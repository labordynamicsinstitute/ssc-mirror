{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:grc1leg2} is an enhanced version of Vince Wiggins' {help grc1leg2##author:grc1leg}.  
	Like {cmd:grc1leg}, {cmd:grc1leg2} is a wrapper for Stata's {help graph combine},
	invoking its ability to array separate, previously drawn graphs as panels 
	in a single combined graph. 
	In addition to allowing all the {help graph combine} options, {cmd:grc1leg2}:{p_end}
{phang}(a) suppresses the display of the legends on the component graphs;{help grc1leg2##old:*}{p_end}
{phang}(b) creates a legend for the combined graph by borrowing the legend 
	previously defined for one of the component graphs;{help grc1leg2##old:*}{p_end}
{phang}(c) optionally changes the position of the legend on the combined graph;{help grc1leg2##old:*}{p_end}
{phang}(d) optionally suppresses the x-titles or the y-titles of the component graphs, 
	borrowing them for the combined graph;{p_end}
{phang}(e) optionally suppresses the main titles, subtitles or notes of the component graphs, 
	borrowing one of them for the corresponding text element of the combined graph;{p_end}
{phang}(f) by default, shrinks all elements of the legend on the combined graph so that
	the sizes of markers and symbols in the legend approximately match their sizes
	in the component panels;{p_end}
{phang}(g) allows user to override the default size of some or all the elements 
	of the legend;{p_end}
{phang}(h) facilitates the calibration and coding of fine adjustments 
	using the dialog {stata db grc1leg2:grc1leg2};{p_end}
{phang}(i) optionally removes all legends from the combined graph (with the option {cmd:loff});{p_end}
{phang}(j) accepts component graphs constructed by -{help graph, by()}-, -{help graph combine}- or {cmd:grc1leg2};{p_end}
{phang}(k) optionally creates a legend for the combined graph that merges the legends of 
component panels ({help grc1leg2##ex_3_10:Example 3.10});{p_end}
{phang}(l) enables application of the {help graph_display:graph display} options to the created combined graph.{p_end}
{phang}(m) can create an Excel-style "bar-of-pie- graph (see Example 3.10c).{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
By default, the characteristics of the common legend are inherited from the original 
	version of the legend in the first component graph, or in the graph specified by the option {opt leg:endfrom(name)}.
	With {cmd:grc1leg2}'s {help grc1leg2##legopts:legend options}, 
	the user can precisely control the placement of the common legend within the combined graph.
	Other {help grc1leg2##legopts:legend options} allow the user to override 
	some of the characteristics of the legend inherited from its original creation
	as part of one of the component graphs.  For example, the size of all markers, 
	symbols or labels in the legend can be increased or decreased.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
When an analyst assembles multiple component graphs into a single combined graph,
	the separate component graphs often share a common x-axis, y-axis or both.  
	In these situations, the appearance and logic of the graph is improved by 
	stripping the titles of the shared axis from all the component graphs, 
	replacing them with a single title for all the shared axes. {cmd:grc1leg2}'s
	{help grc1leg2##titleopts:title options} serve this purpose, allowing 
	the user to replace the separate {it:xtitle}s or {it:ytitle}s 
	on each of the individual graphs with a single {it:b1title}, {it:l1title} or {it:r1title} 
	on the combined graph, which is "borrowed" from one of the component graphs.
	See examples {help grc1leg2##ex_3_3:3.3} and {help grc1leg2##ex_3_9:3.9}.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
Since multi-panel graphs (i.e. combined graphs) are inherently more difficult
	for a reader to interpret than a single graph, it is wise to simplify multi-panel graphs 
	as much as possible. One way to simplify is to assure that the same legend 
	applies to all component graphs. When all panels use the same markers, symbols and 
	labels, the legend from any of the component graphs can serve as the legend 
	for all of them. {cmd:grc1leg2}, like its predecessor {cmd:grc1leg}, 
	simply suppresses the legends on all the component graphs and repurposes 
	or "borrows" one of those legends to serve as the legend for the combined graph.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
But there may be situations in which a user wishes 
	to assemble a combined or multi-panel graph from component graphs which 
	contain different variables, markers, or fill patterns.
	In this situation, none of the component graphs 
	has a legend that works for all panels of the combined graph. 
	Using the option {opt leg:endfrom(name)} together with the option {opt hide:legendfrom} 
	enables the user to create a single legend which includes legend 
	{help legend_options##description:"keys"} from all the combined graphs.  
	See example {help grc1leg2##ex_3_10:3.10}.{p_end}

{p 15}{it}Specifying from which component graph to borrow the legend{sf}{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:legendfrom(}{it:name}{cmd:)} specifies the graph from which the legend for
	the combined graphs is to be taken. The default is the first graph in the
	list.  The argument {it:name} must match one of the names from the list of 
	graph names specified.  The single legend displayed by 
	{cmd:grc1leg2} is drawn from either the first graph name 
	appearing after the the {cmd:grc1leg2} command or from the graph named
	by the {cmd:legendfrom(}{it:name}{cmd:)} option. By default, all
	the characteristics of the legend displayed by {cmd:grc1leg2} are inherited 
	from the legend in that component graph.{help grc1leg2##old:*}{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
{opt hide:legendfrom} hides the graph from which the legend is taken.  
	This option is only useful when none of the component graphs 
	contains all the {help legend_options##description:"keys"}
	for the combined graph.  
	The graph to be hidden should appear last in the list of named graphs.
	See example {help grc1leg2##ex_3_10:3.10}
	.{p_end}

{p 15}{it}Changing the position of the legend{sf}{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
{opth pos:ition(clockpos)} and {opth ring(ringpos)}
    override the default location of the legend, which is usually centered
    below the plot region.  {cmd:position()} specifies a direction {it:(sic)}
    according to the hours on the dial of a 12-hour clock, and {cmd:ring()}
    specifies the distance from the plot region.{help grc1leg2##old:*}

{p 8 8 2}
    {opt ring(0)} specifies that the legend be placed inside the plot, 
	rather than on its periphery.  {opt ring(k)} for {it:k}>0,
    specifies positions outside the plot region; the larger the {cmd:ring()}
    value, the farther away from the plot region is the legend.  {cmd:ring()}
    values may be integers or nonintegers and are treated ordinally. The default is 1.
	See {help legend_options##remark3:Where legends appear} for more detail.{help grc1leg2##old:*}

{p 8 8 2}
    {opt position(12)} puts the legend directly above the plot region
    (assuming {cmd:ring()}>0), {cmd:position(3)} directly to the right
    of the plot region, and so on.{help grc1leg2##old:*}

{p 8 8 2}
	See the 
	{view grc1leg2.sthlp##examples:examples} 
	below for guidance on using the 
	{opth ring(ringpos)}
	and the
	{cmdab:pos:ition:(}{it:{help clockpos}}{cmd:)}
	options and see 
    {hi:Positioning of titles} in
    {it:{help title_options}} for more information on
    the {cmd:position()} and {cmd:ring()} suboptions.

{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:span} specifies that the legend is to be placed in an area spanning the
    entire width (or height) of the graph rather than an area spanning the
    plot region.
    This affects whether the legend is centered with respect to the plot
    region or the entire graph.
    See {hi:Spanning} in
    {it:{help title_options}} for more information on {cmd:span}.{help grc1leg2##old:*}
	
{p 4 8 2}
{cmd:loff} This option "hides" the combined legend. With this option, 
	{cmd:grc1leg2} has the effect of removing from the combined graph 
	all the legends on the component graphs.  
	Since this option only hides the combined legend, but does not delete it, 
	the user can reveal the legend by opening the graph in the 
	{help graph editor}, selecting the legend and clicking "Show".

{p 15}{it}Arranging the elements of the legend{sf}{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
{opt lxo:ffset(real)} and {opt lyo:ffset(real)}	enable fine
	adjustments to the position of the legend on the combined graph.
	The user should first roughly determine the legend's position 
	with the options {opth ring(ringpos)} and {opth pos:ition(clockpos)}
	and then make finer adjustments as necessary with the options
	{opt lxo:ffset(real)} and {opt lyo:ffset(real)}.
	
{p 4 8 2}
{opth lh:oles(numlist)} inserts one or more gaps or "holes" in designated 
	locations in the legend as described {help by_option##byopts:here}.
	Potentially useful for separating legend keys into groups.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
{opt lc:ols(integer)} and {opt lr:ows(integer)}
    specify how the legend symbols and keys are arrayed.  These options invoke the 
    Stata legend options {cmd:cols()} and {cmd:rows()} 
	as described {help by_option##byopts:here}.  However, 
	unlike the changes made by other {cmd:grc1leg2} legend-modifying options,
	the changes to the legend layout effected by
	{opt lc:ols(integer)} and {opt lr:ows(integer)} are not retained
	in a {help gph_files##remarks4:"live"} .gph file. To save the rearranged
	legend layout to a {help gph_files:.gph} file, specify the sub-option {opt asis} 
	in {cmd:grc1leg2}'s {help saving_options:saving} option 
	or on the {help graph save:graph save} command.
	Alternatively, avoid using {opt lc:ols(integer)} and {opt lr:ows(integer)} 
	by rearranging the legend layout in the component graph 
	before executing {cmd:grc1leg2}.{p_end}

{p 15}{it}Specifying the legend's title and/or subititle{sf}{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
{opt lti:tle(text)} and {opt lsubti:tle(text)}

{p 4 8 2}
{opth legs:cale(size)} overrides {cmd:grc1leg2}'s default size reduction 
	of all legend elements. Just as Stata's {help gr combine:gr combine}
	reduces the the size of text and markers in the graphs it combines, 
	{cmd:grc1leg2} automatically reduces the size of all elements in the combined legend 
	as the number of component graphs increases.  For example, if there are 
	two component graphs, {cmd:grc1leg2} internally sets {opth legs:cale(size)} to "*0.8", 
	which reduces the size of all elements in the borrowed legend by 20%.
	If there are eight or nine component graphs, {cmd:grc1leg2} sets 
	{opth legs:cale(size)} to "*0.6". This default behavior has the effect
	of shrinking the size of markers in the legend to approximately
	match the size of those markers in the component graphs.{p_end}
	
{p 4 8 2}
By specifying {opth legs:cale(size)}, the user can shrink or expand all elements of the legend.
	For example, by specifying {opt legscale(*1.1)}, the user instructs {cmd:grc1leg2}
	to magnify the size of all legend elements by 10%.
	{opt legscale(*0.8)} shrinks all elements by 20%.
	{p_end}
	
{p 4 8 2}
To alter the size of one type of legend element, the user specifies 
	the size multiplier for that element type.  Options 
	{opth lts:ize(textsizestyle)} and {opth lsubts:ize(textsizestyle)}
	modify the size of the title or subtitle of the borrowed legend,
	whether they were in the original legend or added by {cmd:grc1leg2}'s 
	options {opt lti:tle(text)} and {opt lsubti:tle(text)}.
	Specifying these options overrides {opth legs:cale(size)} for that element type.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
Four options are available to alter the size of the legend's markers, 
	symbols and labels:	{opth lms:ize(markersizestyle)}, 
	{opth symx:size(size)}, {opth symy:size(size)}
	and {opth labs:ize(textsizestyle)}.
	Specifying these options overrides {opth legs:cale(size)} for that element type.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
Stata's {help twoway} graph commands use graph {help marker_options:"markers"}
	each of which is associated with a set of points in the graph.   
	The option {opth lms:ize(markersizestyle)} enables {cmd:grc1leg2} 
	to control the size of these markers within the legend 
	independently of their size(s) in the component graphs. However, some graphs, 
	notably those produced by {help graph pie} and {help graph bar}, 
	contain no markers. Their legends contain symbols, but no markers. 
	When combining these graphs, {cmd:grc1leg2} 
	permits the option {opth lms:ize(markersizestyle)}, but it has no effect.
	For legends with markers but no symbols, the options {opth symx:size(size)} and 
	{opth symy:size(size)} are permitted but have no effect.{p_end}
	
{p 4 8 2}
By default, {cmd:grc1leg2} reduces the size of all legend elements to correspond 
	to their displayed sizes in the combined graph.  
	Thus the legend and all its elements get smaller with additional component graphs.
	Option {opt noauto:size} disables {cmd:grc1leg2}'s default automatic downsizing
	of legend elements.{p_end}

{title:Remarks}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:grc1leg2} is like Stata's {cmd:graph combine} except it 
	reduces the clutter in the combined graph.  
	The legend displayed is one of the legends from the graphs being combined.  
	Optionally {cmd:grc1leg2} can also suppress the titles 
	on each of the individual graphs, borrowing one of them to apply to the combined graph.
	{cmd:grc1leg2} can also alter characteristics of the borrowed legend and titles 
	as they are displayed in the combined graph.  
	Otherwise, {cmd:grc1leg2} behaves like {help graph_combine}.

{p 4 4 2}
When constructing a multi-panel graph with at least three panels,
	it is rarely satisfying for each panel to have its own legend.
	In most cases, it would be analytically and aesthetically preferable 
	to have a single common legend, with a common set of legend keys, 
	for all panels in the graph.  

{p 4 4 2}
Stata's graph commands offer several ways to display a single
	common legend for all the panels in a multi-panel graph.
	However, by default, Stata puts the legend of a multi-panel 
	graph outside the multi-panel layout, squeezing all the panels 
	either vertically or horizontally.  This solution works logically,
	but typically makes it harder to read the separate panels. 

{p 4 4 2}
With appropriate options, you can enhance the legibility 
	of the multi-panel graph by leaving room for the legend 
	in the multi-panel layout and using the approriate 
	legend options to place the legend in that empty spot.
	In Stata there are several ways to accomplish this objective without 
	resorting to the {help graph editor}:{p_end}

{p 12 16 2}
		a.	When feasible, construct the multi-panel graph using 
			a single graph command with the -by- option.  Stata
			will automatically construct a single legend with keys
			that are common across all panels of the graph.
			Nick Cox's tip #139 
			{browse "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X20976341":here}
			gives many examples showing the power 
			of using {help by_option:graph ..., by()}.{p_end}
{p 12 16 2}
		b.	Optimum legend placement is typically in a "hole" 
			at the bottom right of the multi-panel layout. 
			To achieve this effect, use the legend options:
			- {opt at(#)} {opt position(5)} -.
			The {opt at(#)} option is a powerful tool for placing a legend 
			within a "hole" in a multi-panel graph.  The absence of such an 
			option for the {help graph combine} command is a major 
			reason for the existence of this program, {cmd:grc1leg2}.{p_end}
{p 12 16 2}
		c.	Unlike the {help gr combine} and the

	The above strategies for placing a legend in a "hole" in the multi-panel 
	combined graph apply when the multi-panel graph has at least 3 component graphs
	or panels.  
	The strategies for placing a common legend are more restricted when there are only
	two panels, because in that case 
	Stata's {help by_option:graph ..., by()} 
	and {help gr combine} commands do not respond to the 
	{cmd:holes(}{it:{help numlist}}) option.
	When there are only two panels, {cmd:grc1leg2} is useful for controlling the 
	placement of the legend on the combined graph and for reducing graph clutter 
	by suppressing the x- and y-titles on the component graphs, 
	moving them to the b1- and l1- titles of the combined graph.

	{bf}2.	Examples of a two-step procedure, using {help gr combine}:{p_end}
	======================================================={sf}

{p 4 4 2}
The Stata command {help gr combine} does not have a {cmd:legend} option.
	In order for the combined graph to have only one legend,
	we must assure that only 1 of the component graphs has a legend.  
	Using {help gr combine}, the two steps to the combined graph with legend are:

{p 4 4 2}
	First step: Create the component graphs and name them panel1, 2, 3 and 0.  
	In order for {help gr combine} to display a single common legend, 
	the legends must be suppressed on all but one of the individual component 
	graphs at the time they are originally created. 
	The legend to be displayed can be on the last of the component graphs 
	and can be moved to a "hole" using the xoffset and yoffset options
	at the time this component graph is originally created.  
	Executing the following code creates the named memory graphs {it:panel1}, 
	{it:panel2}, {it:panel3} and {it:panel0} but displays no graphic output.{p_end}

	and specifying the legend on the last graph 
	with options -ring(0) pos(5) xoffset(#)-,
	{help gr combine} does a passable job of 
	creating a multi-panel graph with a single legend. 
	For this approach to work, properly calibrate the offset
	and arrange the placement of the panels to allow
	for a "hole" which can accommodate the legend.{p_end}

	compared with using {help by_option: graph twoway ..., by()} 
	or {cmd:grc1leg2} as demonstrated in examples 1.x and 3.x 
	respectively is that {help gr combine} uses superfluous ink 
	to repeat the axis titles for each panel.  
	(With extra work, the user could suppress the axis titles 
	on each of the component graphs before combining them using {help gr combine}.)
	
{p 4 4 2}
{help gr combine} can equally well display a single legend 
	when there are five panels. In Example 2.2 the legend from the 
	graph in the fifth panel is placed in the space that 
	would otherwise be occupied by a sixth panel.{p_end}

	would be a "hole" in the lower right hand corner of the array.

	{opt pos:ition(6)} or to move it to the right margin with {opt pos:ition(3)}. 
	However, {opt pos:ition(6)} conflicts with the option {opt xtob:1title}
	by putting the x-title below the legend.  
	The solution to using the option {opt xtob:1title} with the legend at the bottom 
	of the combined graph is to use the option {opt ring(2)} instead 
	of the default {opt ring(1)}.  Furthermore, by using the {opt legendfrom} option

{it:Example 3.7:} Like its progenitor {help grc1leg}, {cmd:grc1leg2} is conceived as a utility 
	to add a legend to a composite graph made up of several panels.
	Because a multi-panel graph is already complex, a user would rarely 
	want to further complicate its interpretation by including a panel which 
	itself consists of multiple panels. However, if the user does need to embed a previously  
	created multi-panel graph as one of several panels in a new multi-panel graph, 
	{cmd:grc1leg2} can accommodate.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
Example 3.7 shows that {cmd:grc1leg2} can successfully find and relocate
	the legend on a multi-panel graph created by {help graph, by()}.

To a limited degree {cmd:grc1leg2}, like {cmd: gr combine}, is recursive, accomodating graphs as input
	that it has itself previously constructed.  One could, for example, 
	combine the results of Examples 3.4b and 3.6 with a single legend borrowed from 3.4b like this:{p_end}

{it:Examples 3.10a, 3.10b and 3.10c:} {cmd:grc1leg} and {cmd:grc1leg2} transfer the legend from one of several component graphs 
	to become the legend for the combined graph.  But what if none of the legends of K component graphs includes 
	the keys from all of them?  A solution to this problem is to create one 
	extra graph, the K+1st graph, with a legend containing the keys from all K of the component graphs. 
	Then we borrow the legend from this K+1st graph, but hide the actual K+1st graph.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
Examples 3.10a, 3.10b and 3.10c show how this works.  In Example 3.10a the three desired component graphs 
	are {it:panel7}, {it:panel8}, and {it:panel9}, each with a legend containing different keys.
	So we create a fourth graph, called {it:panel10}, 
	which graphs all three y-axis variables against the common x-axis variable, {it:weight}.
	By specifying the colors of the markers, symbols, labels 
	and fitted lines for all the component graphs, including the auxiliary graph ({it:panel10}), 
	we assure that the elements of the legend displayed by {cmd:grc1eg2} 
	match those in the displayed panels. 
	(For the purposes of this example, we ignore other possible approaches 
	such as measuring price in thousands of dollars or using a 
	{stata "tw (scatter mpg length weight) (scatter price weight, yaxis(2))":second y-axis}.) 

{p 4 4 2}
Using {cmd:grc1leg2}'s option {opt leg:endfrom(graph_name)}, we specify that the combined legend 
	be borrowed from the component graph {it:panel10}, the last of the listed graph names.  
	Also specifying the option {opt hide:legendfrom} 
	instructs {cmd:grc1leg2} to hide the unreadable graph from which the legend has been borrowed.
	The space left by the hidden graph serves as the "hole" for the combined legend.
	The option {opt legend(colfirst cols(2) order(1 2 3 5 4) holes(3))} used to create {it:panel10}
	organizes the legend elements so that all three {it:panel9} markers are grouped 
	together in the second column, improving the legend's readability in the combined graph.
	By default, {cmd:grc1leg2} shrinks all elements of the legend by 30% using the option
	{opt legs:cale(*.7)}, allowing the two-column layout to fit within the available "hole". {p_end}

{it:Example 3.10b:} The same trick can be used to combine a graph without markers, such as by {help graph pie},
	with a graph containing markers, such as {help scatter}. 
	We cannot make an auxiliary graph with a legend containing both pie chart and scatter plot markers
	by simply combining a pie chart with a scatter plot as we did with scatter plots above,

	as the pie chart, we specify the {help pstyle} options {it:p1pie}, {it:p2pie} and 
	{it:p3pie} for the scatter plots in {it:sctr_markers} and also in {it:sym_and_mark}.

For the sole purpose of using its legend in the combined graph, we create a "dummy graph" with five legend keys.
Since we are only using the legend from this graph, we can use any five-category variable to construct the dummy graph.
-auto.dta- concidentally contains a five-category variable, -rep78-.  
So we construct a pie chart over that variable to make a legend with five color swatches.  
In order to spread the legend horizontally,

{ul:Issue 1.}  {cmd:grc1leg2} sometimes fails when the legend designated
	for the combined graph is not "complete" or is otherwise unexpected or degenerate.
	Starting with version 2.10, {cmd:grc1leg2} attempts to detect these conditions and either 
	prevent them or exit politely with an informative error message. If you encounter 
	an error such as 
	{err:series # not found},

	{err: class member function not found}

{ul:Issue 2.}  The changes effected by using {cmd:grc1leg2}'s {opt lr:ows(integer)} or {opt lc:ols(integer)} option 
	are not preserved when the displayed memory graph is saved to disk as a "live" {help gph_files:gph} file.
	To preserve these changes in a saved file, the save must be performed with the

	His version 1.0.5, dated 02jun2010, is available from
	{net "describe grc1leg, from(http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins)":Stata}.
	{cmd:grc1leg2} is a hack of his version 1.0.5.  This help file builds on his 
	original help file for {cmd:grc1leg}, adding documentation
	of {cmd:grc1leg2}'s options and examples of Stata's alternative
	approaches to control the placement of a single legend in a multi-panel 
	graph.  In April 2016, Derek Wagner of StataCorps suggested code 
	to implement the -labsize(textsizestyle)- option.{p_end}
	
{phang}Thanks to Statalist members Florian Schneider and Andrew Musau, 
	who found a bug I introduced in version 1.41 and led me 
	to identify the problem with some legend options which cause {cmd:grc1leg2}
	to fail and to generate the error {err:series # not found}.
	See the discussion of the problem as a {help grc1leg2##known:known issue}.
	{p_end}

{phang}The addition of the {help grc1leg2##grdispopts:{it:gr_display_options}} in version 1.60 is in response 
	to a discussion on Statlist 
	{browse "https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1610172-grc1leg-ignoring-aspect-ratio":here}
	and especially to

	that the aspect ratio of a combined graph could be changed in "post-production" by using {help graph display}.

{phang}Version 2.0 responds to the suggestion of a Statalist member that {cmd:grc1leg2} 
	should allow the user to alter the size of the legend keys 
	and, by default, should shrink those keys for the combined 
	graph in order to preserve their resemblance to the keys in the component graphs.
	To address these issues, this version adds the options {opth legs:cale(size)} and {opth lms:ize(size)}.
	In implementing these changes, I discovered that the edits effected by many 
	previously introduced {cmd:grc1leg2} options were not preserved 
	when the graph was saved using the option {opth saving(saving_option)}.
	This problem is now largely fixed.  The exceptions are {cmd:grc1leg2}'s 
	options {opt lrow()} and {opt lcol()}, the results of which are displayed 
	but not saved to a live {help gph} file.  
	See Examples {help grc1leg2##ex_3_12:3.12 and 3.13} for a work-around.
