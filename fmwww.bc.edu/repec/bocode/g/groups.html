<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>groups</b> lists the distinct groups of <i>varlist</i> occurring in the dataset and
    their frequencies. <b>groups</b> is perhaps most useful with categorical
    variables, but has other uses. Groups are by default presented in the
    sort order of <i>varlist</i>. Note that there is no limit on the number of
    variables in <i>varlist</i>.
<p>
    Frequencies are counts or other measures of abundance.  Percents are
    percents of each total frequency.  Cumulative frequencies and percents
    are cumulated in the order of groups and show frequency (percent) in each
    group and all earlier groups in the listing, unless the <b>lt</b> option is
    specified.  Reverse cumulative frequencies and percents show frequency
    (percent) in all later groups in the listing, unless the <b>ge</b> option is
    specified.  "Valid" percents are calculated relative to all pertinent
    non-missing values.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>fillin</b> specifies that groups (i.e. cross-combinations) of <i>varlist</i> which
        do not occur in the data are shown explicitly as having zero
        frequency.  This has no effect with a single variable. Note that this
        option can bite hard as the number of cross-combinations can explode
        combinatorially.
<p>
    <b>format()</b> specifies a numeric format for percent and cumulative percent
        frequencies. The default is %6.2f.
<p>
    <b>ge</b> specifies that reverse frequencies and percents are to be calculated
        for the current and all later groups, that is, they are for values
        greater than or equal to each value.
<p>
    <b>lt</b> specifies that cumulative frequencies and percents are to be
        calculated for only the previous groups, that is, they are for values
        less than each value.
<p>
    <b>missing</b> specifies that observations with missing values on any of the
        variables in <i>varlist</i> are to be included in the listing.  By default
        they are omitted.  Note that "valid" percents will be the same as
        other percents unless the <b>missing</b> option is specified.
<p>
    <b>order()</b> specifies that groups should be listed in order of their
        frequencies.  Ordering may be <b>high</b> (highest frequencies first) or <b>low</b>
        (lowest frequencies first). <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> may be abbreviated, down to
        as little as <b>h</b> or <b>l</b> respectively.
<p>
    <b>select()</b> specifies that only selected groups are to be listed.  There are
        two syntaxes.
<p>
        In the first syntax, selection is according to a condition imposed on
        the frequencies, or on the percents, or on the cumulative
        frequencies, or on the cumulative percents, or on the reverse
        cumulatives. The syntax is exemplified by
<p>
        <b>select(freq == 1)</b>
        <b>select(percent &gt; 5)</b>
        <b>select(Percent &lt; 50)</b>
<p>
        The element <b>freq</b>, <b>percent</b>, <b>Freq</b>, <b>Percent</b>, <b>RFreq</b>, <b>RPercent</b>, <b>vpercent</b>,
        <b>Vpercent</b> or <b>rvpercent</b> may be abbreviated down to unambiguous
        abbreviations.  Note that case matters in distinguishing <b>freq</b> and
        <b>Freq</b>, <b>percent</b> and <b>Percent</b>, and <b>vpercent</b> and <b>Vpercent</b>.  What follows
        must complete a simple true-or-false condition in Stata syntax,
        typically an inequality or equality.
<p>
        In the second syntax, a positive or negative integer is specified.  A
        positive integer specifies that only the <i>first #</i> groups are to be
        shown. A negative integer specifies that only the <i>last</i> |<i>#</i>| groups are
        to be shown. First and last are determined with respect to the
        listing which would otherwise have been given. Thus with <b>order(h)</b>,
        <b>select(5)</b> shows the 5 groups with the 5 highest frequencies, while
        <b>select(-5)</b> shows the 5 groups with the 5 lowest frequencies, ties
        being broken according to the sort order of <i>varlist</i>. Similarly, with
        <b>order(l)</b> the opposite is true.  Without <b>order()</b>, <b>select(5)</b> shows the
        first 5 groups of <i>varlist</i> and <b>select(-5)</b> shows the last 5 groups of
        <i>varlist</i>. The most obviously useful example is when <i>varlist</i> consists
        of a single variable, so that the listing is of the 5 lowest
        (highest) groups of values of that variable.
<p>
    <b>show()</b> specifies which frequencies should be shown.  By default,
        frequencies, percents and cumulative percents are shown with one
        variable, and frequencies and percents are shown with two or more
        variables, in that order.  <b>show()</b> may be used to specify one or two
        or three of those, and/or cumulative frequencies, and/or reverse
        cumulative frequencies or reverse cumulative percents, and/or
        equivalent percents for "valid" values, or to change the order of
        presentation.  The elements <b>freq</b>, <b>percent</b>, <b>Freq</b>, <b>Percent</b>, <b>RFreq</b>,
        <b>vpercent</b>, <b>Vpercent</b> and <b>rvpercent</b> may be abbreviated, down to
        unambiguous abbreviations.  Note that case matters in distinguishing
        <b>freq</b> and <b>Freq</b>, <b>percent</b> and <b>Percent</b>, or <b>vpercent</b> and <b>Vpercent</b>.
        Exceptionally, <b>none</b> may be used to specify that none of these should
        be shown.  For example, with <b>select(f == 1)</b> the frequencies would all
        be 1, and thus unnecessary, while the percents and cumulative
        percents may not be of interest, so <b>show(none)</b> may be desired.
<p>
    <b>showhead()</b> specifies alternative text for the header explaining frequency
        variables. There should be as many elements as the number of
        frequency, percent, cumulative frequency, cumulative percent, reverse
        cumulative frequency, reverse cumulative percent and valid percent
        variables listed and they should occur in the same order as those
        variables are listed. Text containing spaces should be bound in <b>" "</b>.
        Thus with <b>show(f RF)</b>, <b>showhead(# "# bigger")</b> specifies that
        <b>f</b>requencies are indicated by <b>"#"</b> and the <b>r</b>everse cumulative
        <b>f</b>requencies are indicated by <b>"# bigger"</b>.
<p>
    <b>reverse</b> reverses what would otherwise be displayed, last values first.
<p>
    <i>list_options</i> are options of list. These offer several ways of changing
        the appearance of the listing. Note that <b>sum</b> by itself produces sums
        only of frequencies and percents, where shown.
<p>
    <b>saving()</b> specifies that the results listed will be saved to a named Stata
        .dta file using save. That does not include any sums, means or
        similar summaries. Options of <b>save</b> may be specified in the usual way.
        This option may not be combined with <b>by:</b>.

    Fred Wolfe made very helpful comments. He, Roger Harbord and Eric Zbinden
    all found a bug. A question from Stefan Gawrich led to the <b>ge</b> option.  A
    question from James Keeler led to the <b>reverse</b> option.  A question from
    William Parry led to the <b>saving()</b> option.
