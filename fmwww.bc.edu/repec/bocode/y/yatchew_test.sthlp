{title:Description}

{p 4 4}
This program implements a non-parametric test that
the expectation of Y given D is linear.
The program implements both the original test proposed
by Yatchew (1997) and its heteroskedasticity-robust version proposed 
by de Chaisemartin, D'Haultfoeuille & Gurgand (2024). 
In the vignettes linked below, we sketch the intuition behind the two tests, as 
to motivate the use of the package and its options. 
Please refer to Yatchew (1997) and 
Section 3 of de Chaisemartin, D'Haultfoeuille & Gurgand (2024) for further details.
{p_end}

{p 4 4}
Yatchew (1997) proposes a useful extension of the test 
with multiple independent variables. 
The program implements this extension when the D 
argument has more than one {it:varnames}. 
It should be noted that the power and consistency of 
the test in the multivariate case are not backed by proven 
theoretical results. We implemented this extension to allow 
for testing and exploratory research. 
Future theoretical exploration of the multivariate test will depend on the demand and usage of the package.

{title:Options}

{p 4 4}
{cmd:het_robust} 
By default, the test is performed under the assumption 
of homoskedasticity (Yatchew, 1997). 
If this option is specified, the test 
is performed using the heteroskedasticity-robust 
test statistic proposed by de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2024).
{p_end}

{p 4 4}
{cmd:path_plot}
This option can be used only with exactly two {it:varnames}
as the {it:D} argument. In this case, the program will produce 
a plot of the sequence of (D_1i, D_2i) that minimizes the euclidean 
distance between each pair of consecutive observations 
(see the {it:Multivariate Yatchew Test} vignette for further details).
