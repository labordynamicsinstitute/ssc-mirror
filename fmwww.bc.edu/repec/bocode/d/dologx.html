help for <b>dolog</b><i>x</i>                                                  (Roger Newson)

<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
The programs <b>dolog</b><i>x</i> are versions of the program <b>dolog</b>, each of which attempts
to execute a do-file under the appropriate Stata version <i>x</i>.  <b>dolog</b> is
downloadable from SSC.  Like <b>do</b>, it causes Stata to execute the commands stored
in a file <i>filename</i><b>.do</b>, echos the commands as it executes them, and creates a
text log file <i>filename</i><b>.log</b>.  The program <b>dolog</b><i>x</i> executes the do-file in Stata
version <i>x</i>, unless the user includes a <b>version</b> statement in the do-file.
Usually, a do-file should always contain a <b>version</b> statement at or near the
top, and then it will be executed by <b>dolog</b> (or <b>dolog</b><i>x</i> or <b>do</b> or <b>run</b>) in the
version of Stata in which it was written. However, some do-files, such as
certification scripts, should not contain a <b>version</b> statement, because it is
important to prove that they execute correctly under multiple versions of Stata
(Gould, 2001).
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
The <b>dolog</b><i>x</i> package is distributed separately from the <b>dolog</b> package.  This is
because the <b>dolog</b><i>x</i> package is intended for use by advanced programmers (eg
programmers who write certification scripts), and such advanced programmers
will often have access to two versions of Stata at the same time while in
transition from one version to another, and will therefore probably want to
update their versions of <b>dolog</b><i>x</i> immediately when they start to have access to
the new version of Stata, and to update their versions of <b>dolog</b> later, when the
transition is complete. Note that, if the user includes a <b>version</b> command at
the top of a do-file, then it does not matter whether the user uses <b>dolog</b> or
<b>dolog</b><i>x</i>, because Stata will then execute the do-file in the version of Stata
indicated at the top of the do-file, as long as that version, and the version
of <b>dolog</b> or <b>dolog</b><i>x</i>, are no higher than the version of the Stata executable
being used.

<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
The following examples execute a certification script <b>parmest.do</b> in Stata 7 and
Stata 8, respectively, each time creating a text log file <b>parmest.log</b>. This is
done to prove that the examples in <b>parmest.do</b> work under both Stata versions.
