      <b><u>c</u></b><b>olor</b>(colorstylelist)  specifies the two colours for the two separate
                              range areas.
      <b><u>a</u></b><b>dd</b>                    specifies that markers are plotted in addition
                              to the range plots.
      twoway_options         specifies additional options in the graphic.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    Multiple graphics are produced in Stata by the rule "last drawn first
    seen". So the objects that are drawn last are the ones that are observed.
    The implication of this principle is that when overlapping two rarea
    graphs the overlapping area is hidden by the second rarea graph.  This
    command <b>drarea</b> overlays two range area plots by merging the two colours
    and hence highlighting the true overlap. There are numerous graphics that
    could benefit from the same principles but at the moment the graphics
    engine does not remember what is beneath the plots that are observed.

    <b><u>c</u></b><b>olor</b>(colorstylelist) specifies the two colours for the two separate
        range areas. The option requires the same colorstyle be used and can
        handle both the words or the RGB format (CYMK is not supported at the
        moment). <b>Note:</b> if a third colour is specified then this will be the
        colour of the overlapping area.
<p>
    <b><u>a</u></b><b>dd</b> specifies that markers are plotted in addition to the range plots.

    gen high2 = high+15*uniform()
<p>
    gen low2 = low+15*uniform()
<p>
