<b>denton</b> is for use with time-series data.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before using
<b>denton</b>; see tsset. <b>denton</b> may be used on a single time series of a panel which
has been <b>tsset</b> or <b>xtset</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>denton</b> computes the proportional Denton method of interpolation of a
low-frequency time series by use of an associated higher-frequency indicator
series, imposing the constraints that the interpolated series obeys the
original low-frequency series totals. The method is described in IMF Chapter 6,
Benchmarking (2001) as "relatively simple, robust, and well-suited for
large-scale applications."
<p>
<b>denton</b> requires that the low-frequency variable be an annual or quarterly time
series, while the indicator variable may be of quarterly or monthly frequency.
Although the procedure is usually applied to flow series (such as GDP), it may
be applied to stock series applying the <b>stock</b> option, where both the
low-frequency and indicator variables are stock series.  The method may be
particularly useful in cases where, due to sizable statistical discrepancy,
quarterly series do not integrate to annual totals. The indicator series only
contribute their pattern to the interpolation; thus it is quite feasible to use
both quarterly and annual flow series expressed at an annual rate. In this
instance the interpolated series will be at a quarterly rate.
<p>
<b>denton</b> is a least squares approach, in which the high-frequency estimates to be
derived are the parameters, and the sum of squares involved are the first
differences of the X/I ratio:  the ratio of the interpolated series (X) to the
indicator series (I). The problem is a constrained least squares problem which
may be written as a Lagrangian expression in the minimand and the constraints,
one of which is defined for each low-frequncy observation.
<p>
The low-frequency variable to be interpolated is specified as <b>varname</b>. The
<b>using</b> clause specifies the filename of the Stata data (.dta) file to be
created, containing the new series. This must be a new file.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b><u>int</u></b><b>erp()</b>, a required option, specifies the name of the high-frequency indicator
    variable. As the proportional Denton method requires that the indicator
    variable is strictly positive, the indicator variable is adjusted prior to
    use if it contains nonpositive values.
<p>
<b>from()</b>, a required option, specifies the name of the Stata dataset containing
    the indicator variable. This dataset must be <b>tsset</b> as a single time-series.
<p>
<b><u>gen</u></b><b>erate()</b>, a required option, specifies the name of the new variable which
    will contain the interpolated series within the defined sample.  The file
    created (as specified in <b>from()</b>) will store the interpolated series along
    with the X (low-frequency) series and the new time variable.  The new
    variable's observations over each calendar year will sum to the
    low-frequency total given in the X series.  That may be verified, as the
    routine indicates, by making use of <b>tscollap</b>.
<p>
<b>stock</b> may be used to specify that both of the time-series to be used are stock
    series.  In that case both the low-frequency and indicator series are
    differenced, the interpolated variable is created, and then integrated via
    <b>sum()</b>, after adding the initial value.  Because of differencing, the new
    variable is not interpolated for the first low-frequency period.
<p>
<b>old</b> may be used to specify that the new file is saved in Stata 11 format if
    <b>denton</b> is run under Stata 12+.
