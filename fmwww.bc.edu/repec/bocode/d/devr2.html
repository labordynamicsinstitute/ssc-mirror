<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>devr2</b> -- Calculates a deviance based R-squared measure for models
        estimated using the <b>[R] glm</b> command. The measure is based on Cameron
        and Windmeijer, 1997.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>devr2</b> calculates a deviance based R-squared measure for regression models
    in the exponential family with known scale parameter. This is equal to
<p>
        1-[(deviance of the fitted model)/(deviance of the constant only
        model)]
<p>
    It measures the proportionate reduction in recoverable information due to
    the inclusion of regressors, where information is measured by the
    estimated Kullback-Leibler divergence, and may be loosely interpreted as
    the fraction of uncertainty explained by the fitted model.
<p>
    Further details are given in Cameron and Windmeijer, 1997.
<p>
    Currently, the command can only be used following model estimation using
    the <b>[R] glm</b> command.
