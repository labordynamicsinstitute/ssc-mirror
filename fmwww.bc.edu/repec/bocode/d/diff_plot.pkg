d 'DIFF_PLOT': module to visualize classic difference-in-differences model 
d
d   diff_plot is designed to create a customized visual
d representation of the canonical difference-in-differences (DiD)
d estimation, which is commonly used in causal inference. This
d program is tailored for the simplest 2x2 case, where we have one
d treatment group, one control group, one period prior to
d intervention, and one period post-intervention. It generates a
d line graph that illustrates the changes in an outcome variable
d over the two time periods for both the treatment and control
d groups. Crucially, the graph also includes an optional parallel
d trend line, which simulates the counterfactual trend for the
d treatment group in the absence of any treatment, based on the
d parallel trend assumption. This tool is particularly useful for
d organizations such as NGOs and research institutions that have
d baseline and midline/endline data and want to visualize changes
d in both the treatment and control groups as part of their project
d evaluations.
