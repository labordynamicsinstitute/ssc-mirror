d 'DID_MULTIPLEGT_OLD': module to estimate sharp Difference-in-Difference designs with multiple groups and periods
d
d	did_multiplegt_old estimates the effect of a treatment on
d an outcome, using group- (e.g. county- or state-) level panel   
d data with multiple groups and periods.  Like other recently
d proposed DID estimation commands (csdid, didimputation, ...),   
d did_multiplegt_old can be used with a binary and staggered
d (absorbing) treatment. But unlike those other commands,   
d did_multiplegt_old can also be used with a non-binary treatment
d (discrete or continuous) that can increase or decrease   
d multiple times.  The panel of groups may be unbalanced: not all
d groups have to be observed at every period (see FAQ section	
d for more info on that). The data may also be at a more
d disaggregated level than the group level (e.g. individual-level
d wage	  data to measure the effect of a regional-level
d minimum-wage on individuals' wages).
