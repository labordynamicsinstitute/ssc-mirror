<b><u>Change double-type variables to float where possible.</u></b>
<p>
        <b>doubletofloat</b> [<i>varlist</i>]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    This is simply a convenience, issuing <b>recast float</b> <i>varlist2</i>, where
    <i>varlist2</i> is the set of variables in <i>varlist</i> that are of type <b>double</b>.
    This has some resemblance to, and is intended to complement <b>compress</b>,
    which does not include the possibility of changing <b>double</b> to <b>float</b>.
<p>
    <b>doubletofloat</b> would be typically used immediately following <b>compress</b>, and
    saves you the trouble of seeking out all the remaining <b>double</b> variables.
    There are some potental complications if you do not preceed it with
    <b>compress</b>; see notes under <b>Remarks</b>.
<p>
    If no <i>varlist</i> is specified, <b>_all</b> is assumed.
<p>
    <b>doubletofloat</b> ignores variables that are not <b>double</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. doubletofloat</b>
<p>
    <b>. doubletofloat wage income</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    This is for those instances when you have some <b>double</b> variables which
    could be stored as <b>float</b> without any loss of precision, but do require
    <b>float</b> rather than an integer type.  Thus, there are fractional values
    present, but all can be represented exactly using <b>float</b>.  Typical values
    would have fractional parts involving halves and quarters, etc., such as
    in 2.5, 2.75, and 10.375.
<p>
    It is best to use this immediately following <b>compress</b>.  If you use it
    without a preceeding <b>compress</b>, you might recast some variables to <b>float</b>
    which would otherwise become <b>long</b>, <b>int</b>, or <b>byte</b>.  If you use it without a
    preceeding <b>compress</b>, but you do follow it with <b>compress</b>, then those
    variables that <b>compress</b> would have recast as <b>int</b> or <b>byte</b> (but not <b>long</b>)
    had it been called first, will still receive that change.
<p>
    For a similar related program, see floattolong by the same author.  Both
    <b>doubletofloat</b> and <b>floattolong</b> are intended as companions to <b>compress</b>, and
    would best be used as follows:
<p>
    <b>. compress</b>
    <b>. floattolong</b>
    <b>. doubletofloat</b>
<p>
    Note that in this sequence, the relative placement of <b>floattolong</b> is not
    critical, as long as <b>compress</b> comes before <b>doubletofloat</b>.  (The sequence
    <b>doubletofloat</b>, <b>compress</b>, <b>floattolong</b> should also work properly, but it is
    easiest to remember to place <b>compress</b> first.)
<p>
    In general data preparation, <b>doubletofloat</b> would usually be called
    without a <i>varlist</i>; there is little point in calling it with a specific
    set of variables, since you could just as well type <b>recast float</b> with the
    same <i>varlist</i>.  The exception is where you use it within a program that
    generates a variable that is initially <b>double</b>, and you want to clean up
    that one variable without affecting others.
