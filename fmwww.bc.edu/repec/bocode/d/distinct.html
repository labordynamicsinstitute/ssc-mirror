<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>distinct</b> -- Report number(s) of distinct observations or values
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>distinct</b> [<i>varlist</i>] [<i>if</i>] [<i>in</i>] [<b>,</b> <b><u>miss</u></b><b>ing</b> <b><u>a</u></b><b>bbrev(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <b><u>j</u></b><b>oint</b> <b><u>min</u></b><b>imum(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b>
                 <b><u>max</u></b><b>imum(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> ]
<p>
    <b>by</b> is allowed; see <b>[D] by</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>distinct</b> command displays the number of distinct observations with
    respect to the variables in <i>varlist</i>.  By default, each variable is
    considered separately so that the number of distinct observations for
    each variable is reported; the number of distinct observations is the
    same as the number of distinct values.  Optionally, variables can be
    considered jointly so that the number of distinct groups defined by the
    values of variables in <i>varlist</i> is reported.
<p>
    By default, missing values are not counted.  <i>varlist</i> may contain both
    numeric and string variables.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>missing</b> specifies that missing values are to be included in counting
    distinct observations.
<p>
    <b>abbrev(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies that variable names are to be displayed abbreviated
    to at most <i>#</i> characters.  This option has no effect with <b>joint</b>.
<p>
    <b>joint</b> specifies that distinctness is to be determined jointly for the
    variables in <i>varlist</i>.
<p>
    <b>minimum(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies that numbers of distinct values are to be displayed
    only if they are equal to or greater than a specified minimum.
<p>
    <b>maximum(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies that numbers of distinct values are to be displayed
    only if they are less than or equal to a specified maximum.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    Distinctness, duplication, and uniqueness are different aspects of the
    similarity and difference of observations.  Suppose the values of some
    variable are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4.  Then there are four distinct
    values: 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Alternatively, there are, so far as this
    variable is concerned, four distinct observations because, for example,
    the second and third observations both containing the value 2 are
    identical in respect to this variable.  Of these values, 2, 3, and 4 are
    duplicated in the data, meaning that each occurs twice or more.  Some
    people refer to the distinct values as unique values, even though in
    general distinct values could all be repeated in the data.  One logic
    behind that terminology is that if you remove all duplicates from these
    data then you are left with four distinct values, each of which occurs
    once.
<p>
    Now consider distinctness determined jointly for two variables.  Suppose
    observations are 1 and <b>"a"</b>, 2 and <b>"b"</b>, 2 and <b>"b"</b>, 3 and <b>"c"</b>, 3 and <b>"c"</b>, 3
    and <b>"d"</b>, 4 and <b>"c"</b>, 4 and <b>"c"</b>, 4 and <b>"d"</b>, 4 and <b>"d"</b>.  Then, as far as
    these two variables are concerned, there are six distinct observations, 1
    and <b>"a"</b>, 2 and <b>"b"</b>, 3 and <b>"c"</b>, 3 and <b>"d"</b>, 4 and <b>"c"</b>, 4 and <b>"d"</b>.
    Considering the variables individually, there are four distinct values
    for the first variable and four for the second.  Clearly, the same
    principles of considering variables individually and jointly extend to
    three or more variables.

<b><u>Saved results</u></b>
<p>
    <b>distinct</b> saves the following in <b>r()</b>:
<p>
    Scalars  
      <b>r(ndistinct)</b>  distinct count (for last variable, or jointly considered
                      group of variables, and, if specified, last <b>by</b> group)
      <b>r(N)</b>          number of observations (for last variable, or jointly
                      considered group of variables, and, if specified, last
                      <b>by</b> group)
