<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>docharedit</b> - Editing characteristics to be run by dochar
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>docharedit</b> <i>evarname</i><b>[</b><i>charname</i><b>]</b> [[<b>"</b>]<i>text</i>[<b>"</b>]]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>docharedit</b> is used to edit characteristics which are run by dochar. To
    make life easier, they are edited in a Do-file editor window. This has
    two advantages: things are much more readable in the Do-file editor, and
    there are fewer details to deal with when it comes to special local 
    macros used by dochar.
<p>
<b><u>Example</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. docharedit myvar[valid_check]</b>
        edits the <b>valid_check</b> characteristic attached to the variable <b>myvar</b>.
<p>
<b><u>Notes</u></b>
<p>
    A more condition will appear in the results window. Do <b>not</b> clear it until
    <b>after</b> you have finished editing and have closed the Do-file editor
    window.  If you clear the more condition, any unsaved or later changes
    will not be saved.
<p>
    See docharprog for details about how to write do files which can be
    stored as characteristics.
