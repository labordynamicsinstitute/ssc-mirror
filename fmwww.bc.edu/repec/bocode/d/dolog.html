help for <b>dolog</b>                                                   (Roger Newson)

<b><u>Execute commands from a do-file, creating a log file</u></b>
<p>
        <b>dolog</b> <i>filename</i> [ <i>arguments</i> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>dolog</b> (like <b>do</b>) causes Stata to execute the commands stored in <i>filename</i><b>.do</b> as
if they were entered from the keyboard, and echos the commands as it executes
them, creating a text log file <i>filename</i><b>.log</b>.  If <i>filename</i> is specified without
an extension, filename.do is assumed. If <i>filename</i> is specified with an
extension, then the log file will have <b>.log</b> as an additional extension (so
<b>dolog</b> will not overwrite the original do-file).  Arguments are allowed (as with
<b>do</b> or <b>run</b>), but the <b>nostop</b> option is not available.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
The original version of <b>dolog</b> was apparently an example given as <b>dofile</b> in a
Stata NetCourse. This version is slightly improved.
<p>
Note that a do-file should nearly always start with a <b>version</b> statement at or
near the top. This is because, nearly always, we prefer the do-file to run in
the Stata version in which it was written, even if the version of Stata has
been upgraded. This practice also ensures that, if the do-file is run using
<b>dolog</b>, then it is run under its own Stata version, and not under the Stata
version of the current version of <b>dolog</b>.
<p>
An exception to this rule occurs when the do-file is a certification script.
For these, it is better to use the <b>dologx</b> package instead of<b> dolog</b>. To find
unofficial Stata packages which you might want to download, use <b>net search</b> or 
<b>findit</b>.
