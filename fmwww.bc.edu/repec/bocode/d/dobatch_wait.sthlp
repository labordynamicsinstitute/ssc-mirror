{p 4 4 2}{cmd:dobatch_wait} {hline 2} Wait for do-file batch processes to complete.


{title:Syntax}

{p 8 14 2}{cmd:dobatch_wait} [, {cmd:pid(}{help numlist:numlist}{cmd:)}]


{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:dobatch_wait} pauses the current Stata session until prior Stata batch processes launched by {help dobatch:dobatch} have finished running. It operates in one of two modes:

{p 8 8 2}1. If no {cmd:pid(}{help numlist:numlist}{cmd:)} option is provided, {cmd:dobatch_wait} checks the global macro DOBATCH_STATA_PID for process identifiers (PIDs) of jobs launched by {cmd:dobatch}, 
and waits for each process to complete.
If DOBATCH_STATA_PID is undefined, {cmd:dobatch_wait} instead waits for all other active Stata MP processes (excluding the current one) to complete.
Once complete, {cmd:dobatch_wait} clears the contents of DOBATCH_STATA_PID.

{p 8 8 2}2. If {cmd:pid(}{help numlist:numlist}{cmd:)} is specified, {cmd:dobatch_wait} waits for the specified PIDs to terminate. These may include any processes, not just Stata jobs.

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:dobatch_wait} requires a Unix-based system.


{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:pid(}{help numlist:numlist}{cmd:)} specifies one or more process identifiers (PIDs), which are unique numbers assigned by the operating system to each process.
When this option is used, {cmd:dobatch_wait} pauses Stata until all specified PIDs have terminated.
Note: the stored result {cmd:r(PID)} from {help rscript:rscript} (if installed) contains the PID of do-files launched with that command.

{p 4 4 2}The following global macros can be used to adjust the default settings:

{p 8 14 2} DOBATCH_WAIT_TIME_MINS: time interval (in minutes) before checking for running processes again

{p 8 14 2} DOBATCH_DISABLE: if set equal to 1, {cmd:dobatch_wait} does nothing


{title:Stored results}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:dobatch_wait} stores the following in {cmd: r()}:

{p 4 4 2}Scalars

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:r(WAIT_TIME_MINS)}     {space 5} WAIT_TIME_MINS parameter value
