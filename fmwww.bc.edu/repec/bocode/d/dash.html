The DASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom questions (30 item
&gt; s in
the regular version and 11 items in the quick version of the DASH, scored 1-5)
and the optional high performance sport/music or work section (4 items, scored 
&gt; 1-5).
<p>
Syntax: 
^dash^ varlist [if] [in], generate(newvarname) [optional] [quick]
<p>
        ^varlist^ must contain the 30 numeric variables to calculate the DASH s
&gt; core.
<p>
        ^gen(^varname^)^ is used to specify where the score has to be stored.
<p>
        ^optional^ is specified if the optional component of the DASH has to be
&gt;  calculated.
        This option requires ^varlist^ to contain 4 numeric variables.
                
        ^quick^ is specified if the quick version of the DASH has to be calcula
&gt; ted.
        This option requires ^varlist^ to contain 11 numeric variables.
<p>
                  
Examples: 
<p>
^dash^ DASH1-DASH30, gen(DASH)  
^dash^ DASH*, gen(DASH)
^dash^ DASHop1-DASHop4, GEN(DASH_sport) optional
^dash^ DASH1-DASH11, gen(QuickDASH) quick 
<p>
<p>
Note:
The variables containing the information for the calculation have to be numeric
&gt; al and 
contain values between 1 and 5. 
<p>
Treatment of Missing Data:
A summary score is calculated if a respondent answered at least 27 out of 30 qu
&gt; estions 
for the disability/symptom component of the DASH.
A summary score is calculated if a respondent answered at least 10 out of 11 qu
&gt; estions 
for the disability/symptom component of the Quick DASH.
No imputation of missing data is performed for the optional component of the DA
&gt; SH, where
all four questions have to be completed in order to have a score calculated.
