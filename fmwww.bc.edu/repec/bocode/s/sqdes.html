<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sqdes</b> is a way to describe the concentration of sequences in the dataset.
    Considering the limiting case when all respondents share the same
    sequence, one would speak of a high concentration of sequences, whereas
    one would speak of a low concentration if all observed sequences were
    unique. Hence, the more only a few sequences are shared by many
    respondents, the higher the concentration of sequences is, whereas the
    more sequences that are unique, the lower the concentration.
<p>
    The command<b> sqdes</b> provides this and some further information about the
    concentration or diversification of sequences.

<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>so</b> is used to request a frequency table, where similar sequences have
        been grouped together beforehand. The concept for similarity used
        with the option <b>so</b> is called same-order similarity, because it treats
        sequences where the elements appear in the same order. The sequence
        A-B-B-A would be treated identical to A-B-A-A, because the elements A
        and B appear in the same order in both sequences (first A, then B,
        and then A again).
<p>
    <b>se</b> is used to request a frequency table, where similar sequences have
        been grouped together beforehand. The concept for similarity used
        with the option <b>so</b> is called same-elements similarity, because it
        treats sequences that consist of the same elements as identical.
        Hence, with this option the sequence B-A-A-B would be treated as
        identical to A-B-B-A, because both sequences consist of the elements
        A and B.
<p>
    <b>graph</b> provides a simple vertical bar chart of the table presented with
        <b>sqdes</b>. Sequences are highly concentrated if many and/or high bars are
        on the right of the graph, and fairly unique if they are on the left.
        You can specify all options available for <b>graph twoway bar</b> to further
        control the look of the graph.
<p>
    <b>gapinclude</b> is used to include sequences with gaps in the tabulation. The
        default behavior is to drop sequences with gaps from the tabulation,
        because they cannot be used in the program <b>sqom</b>.  The term "gap"
        refers only to missing values on the element variable within a
        sequence. Sequences with missing values at the beginning and at the
        end of a sequence are included in any case. See sq for details.
<p>
<p>
    <b>subsequence(a,b)</b> is used to include only the part of the sequence that is
        between position a and b, whereby a and b refer to the position
        defined in the order variable.
