TITLE: spmap - Module to visualize spatial data

DESCRIPTION: spmap is aimed at visualizing several kinds of spatial data,
and is particularly suited for drawing thematic maps and displaying the
results of spatial data analyses. Proper specification of spmap options
and suboptions, combined with the availability of properly formatted
spatial data, allows the user to draw several kinds of maps, including
choropleth maps, proportional symbol maps, pin maps, pie chart maps,
and noncontiguous area cartograms. spmap completely supersedes its
predecessor tmap.

Requires: Stata version 9.2
