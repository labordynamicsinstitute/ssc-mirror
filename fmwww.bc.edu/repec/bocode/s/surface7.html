Description
-----------
<p>
The function attempts to draw a wireframe plot from three variables.
Var1 specifies the x-coordinate, var2 the y-coordinate and var3 the 
z-coordinate. Alternatively the function can draw a circle at each 
point and add a straight line going 
down to the lowest point.
<p>
This function can handle data that is not in the form of a matrix of values.
However if there are too many x- and y- values the function will attempt 
to round the dataset values into a more reasonable spread of values. This 
will result in very messy figures. However in s uch a case it is the 
impression that is needed. Many otehr statistical packages require a full 
matrix of values. This is not a problem for the ^nowire^ option.
<p>
At present the state of rotating the diagram is limited to interchanging the 
axes.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^saving^(^filename)^ this will save the resulting graph in filename.gph.
If the file already exists it is ^DELETED^ and the new graph will be saved.
<p>
^nowire^ this suppresses the drawing of the wire frame in exchange for lines 
<p>
^round()^, data is automatically rounded if there are too many x and y 
values. This option controls the amount of rounding, for example round(1) 
rounds the x and y values to the nearest integer.
<p>
^orient()^ this function must take the letters xyz or a combination of them.
Whichever letter comes first is the x-axis, second is y-axis and third is 
the z-axis. Thus orient(zxy) means that var1 is now the y coordinates, var2 
is the z-coordinates and var3 is the x-coordinates. This is different from 
changing the variables around since the wireframe is still draw across the 
original x and y values. This is a crude attempt to implement rotation to 
obtain a clearer picture.
<p>
^xtitle(string)^ specifies the title for the X-axis, the default is "X-axis"
<p>
^ytitle(string)^ specifies the title for the Y-axis, the default is "Y-axis"
<p>
^ztitle(string)^ specifies the title for the Z-axis, the default is "Z-axis"
<p>
