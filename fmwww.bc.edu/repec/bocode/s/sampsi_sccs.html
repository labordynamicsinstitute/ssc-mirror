<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sampsi_sccs</b> estimates the sample size for a self-controlled case series
    study design (see Whitaker et al (2006)).  Optionally, one may control
    for the confounding effects of age. The formulae are taken from Musonda
    et al (2006).  The program gives the required number of events rather
    than the number of subjects, but Musonda recommends (p2626) taking
    n<i>_subjects</i> = n<i>_events</i>.

<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
        +---------+
    ----+ Options +----------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>alpha(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the type 1 error level; default is 0.05
<p>
    <b>power(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the power; default is 0.90
<p>
    <b>rho(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the incidence rate of the event in the post-exposure
        risk period relative to that in the baseline (unexposed) period;
        default is 2
<p>
    <b>method(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> specifies the method of estimation. <i>string</i> is one of <b>bin</b>,
        <b>srl</b> or <b>age</b>; the default is <b>bin</b>.
<p>
        <b>bin</b> specifies the binomial method [Eqns (6) and (3) of Musonda] using
            an arcsin transformation.
        <b>srl</b> (<i>that's "el"</i>) specifies the signed root likelihood ratio method
            [Eqns (9) and (3) of Musonda].
        <b>age</b> specifies the signed root likelihood ratio method with adjustment
            for the effect of age [Eqn (12) of Musonda].
<p>
    <b>onsesided</b> specifies a one-sided alpha; the default is a two-sided alpha.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
      (1) Use the binomial method to estimate the sample size required to
          show a 5-fold increase in incidence of disease during a 2 day
          period of risk following exposure when the entire observation
          period is 200 days and all subjects are exposed. Power is 0.9 for a
          two-tailed test at the 0.05 level. The program will prompt for
          relevant input.

<p>
            2-tailed alpha is:                                          .05
            power is:                                                   .9
            relative incidence associated with exposure is:             5
            post-exposure risk period is:                               2
<p>
            total number of events required in exposed subjects is:    94
<p>
            total number of events required in unexposed subjects is:   0
<p>
            Total number of events required is:                        94
          ==================================================================
<p>
           Note 1: all subjects were exposed, so zero events would be seen in
                    the unexposed.
           Note 2: the sample size depends, <i>inter alia</i>, on the ratio of risk
                    period to total observation period, and not on where
                    within the observation period the risk is experienced.
<p>
<p>
      (2) Use the signed root likelihood ratio method to estimate the sample
          size required to show a 3-fold increase in incidence of disease in
          infants during a 42 day post-exposure risk period when the
          observation period is the second year of life (days 366-730), and
          this total observation period is broken into 4 age sub-periods: the
          first 3 are of 91 days each, and the last is 92 days.  The
          proportions exposed in each age group are 0.6, 0.2, 0.05 and 0.05
          respectively.  The incidence of disease within age groups, relative
          to the first age are 1, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.4 respectively. Desired
          power is 0.8 for a two-tailed test at the 0.05 level. This example
          is from Musonda section 7.3.
