<b><u>Spike model for Williness to Pay</u></b>
<p>
<p>
        <b>spike</b> {s} {t} {bid}
<p>
    where
<p>
    <b>s</b> is the variable that indicates if the respondent would like to
    contribute at all to the project (S =1 if WTP&gt;0).
<p>
    <b>t</b> is the variable that indicates if the repondent would like to
    contribute to the project at the price offered (T =1 if WTP&gt;AMOUNT).
<p>
    <b>bid</b> is the variable that reports the bid value offered to the respondent.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>spike</b> command allows for a non-zero probability of zero
    willingness-to-pay in referendum-style contingent valuation experiments
    as suggested by Kristrom (1997). This property is particular usefull in
    experiments in which a large fraction of the population chose not to
    consume good being offered. In such circunstances the use of traditional
    parametric models based on probit and logit models are likelly to predict
    a negative willingness-to-pay.
