{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd} {cmd:sqpercentageplot} shows stacked bar charts of the
percentage distribution of elements by the ordervar. Option
{cmd:twoway} overlays a line for the entropy.{p_end}

{pstd} Note that this plot is not a sequence analysis method in the
strict sense, as it does not treat the sequence holistically. However,
percentage plots such as this one are frequently used in the context
of sequence analysis. {p_end}

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{phang}{opt entropy} overlays a line plot for the entropy by position
{p_end}

{phang}{opt nosecond} erases the shadow line. By default,
{cmd:sqpercentageplot} displays a tiny white border around the the
line for the entropy in order to make the line more standout. This is
often useful when displaying the line in the foreground of stacked
bars that already have many colors. The option {cmd:nosecond} turns
this shadow line off.  {p_end}

{phang}{opt baropts()} Options to control the appearance of the
 bars. All options described under {cmd:help} {help barlook_options}
 are allowed.  {p_end}

{phang}{opt lopts()} Options to control the appearance of the entropy
line. All options described under {cmd:help} {help connect_options} are allowed.
 {p_end}

{phang}{opt l2opts()} Options to control the appearance of the shadow
 line. All options described under {cmd:help} {help connect_options}
 are allowed.  {p_end}

{phang}{it: twoway options} are any options allowed for {cmd:graph twoway};
 see {cmd:help} {help twoway_options}.  {p_end}
