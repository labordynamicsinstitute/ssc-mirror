<b><u>Spearman's rank correlation</u></b>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>spearman2</b> performs the same functions as Stata's original <b>spearman</b> with one
exception. If a <i>varlist</i> of two variables is given, <b>spearman</b> produces a test of
the hypothesis of a zero rank correlation, and provides a p-value for that
test. It does not display the test statistic. In contrast, <b>spearman2</b> calculates
and displays the standard error of the coefficient, and displays the
t-statistic for the test as well as its degrees of freedom. These items are
returned as r(rhose), r(rhot), r(rhodf) respectively.
