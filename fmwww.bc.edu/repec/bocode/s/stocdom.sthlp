{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:stocdom} calculates bounds for treatment effects in randomized controlled trials in the presence of survey attrition, when stochastic dominance is assumed as in Zhang and Rubin (2003). In this context stochastic dominance implies that the outcomes of individuals that are always observed are higher than those that are observed contingent on treatment assignment. The command bounds the treatment effect for the always observed.
