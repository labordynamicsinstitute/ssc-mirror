d 'SCCSDTA': module to generate a dataset for the self-controlled case series method (SCCS)
d
d      The SCCS method examines the association between a
d time-varying exposure and an event outcome.	 The study samples
d onlyÂ cases, and it requires that an event has occurred during
d the observation period.    The method doesn't compare incidences
d for cases with incidences for references.    Instead, it
d contrasts incidences in periods of risk with incidences in
d periods where the case is not at risk.    In this approach, cases
d serve as their control for fixed confounders.    It's feasible to
d adjust for time effects such as age.	  The intervals are marked
d by risk, time, and individual.    For each interval, the number
d of incidences and the width of the interval are determined.
