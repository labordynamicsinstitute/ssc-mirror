Skewed bimodal generator

Description
-----------
<p>
The program generates random numbers from a bimodal distribution. The two unimo
&gt; dal distributions
that make up the bimodal can be normal or skewed-normal (see sknor for more det
&gt; ails). Different
arguments can be inputted to the function, as specified by 'option'
<p>
p: the probability of the 1st unimodal distribution (obviously the prob for the
&gt;  2nd will be 1-p)
option: takes values 1, 2 or 3 and defines v1-v4.
    for option=1: v1 the mean v2 the variance of the 1st unimodal, v3 the mean 
&gt; v4 the variance of the 2nd unimodal
    for option=2: v1 the mean v2 the variance of the bimodal, v3 &amp; v4 the varia
&gt; nces of the unimodals
    for option=3: v1 the mean v2 the variance of the bimodal, v3 the mean v4 th
&gt; e variance of the 1st unimodal
[obs]: number of observations to be generated (optional; set to current
    dataset size if omitted)
[seednum]: seed number to be used for drawing 'random' numbers - makes a differ
&gt; ence if your simulations occur
    on the same second (i.e. running a batch of simulations)
[sk1]: skewness of the 1st unimodal (optional; set to 0 if omitted)
[ku1]: kurtosis of the 1st unimodal (optional; set to 3 if omitted)
[sk2]: skewness of the 2nd unimodal (optional; set to 0 if omitted)
[ku2]: kurtosis of the 2nd unimodal (optional; set to 3 if omitted)

Remarks
-------
<p>
When using options 2 and 3, parameters of the distribution may not be computed 
&gt; for certain sets of
inputted values.
    for option 1 it must hold that: var - p*var(d1) - (1-p)*var(d2)&gt;=0
    for option 2 it must hold that: var &gt; p*var(d1) + p(1-p)*(m1-m2)^2
    where var the variance of the bimodal; m1,m2,v1,v2 means and variances of t
&gt; he unimodals
<p>
For the default skewness and kurtosis values the generated distributions are no
&gt; rmal.
The program is based on a method described in  "Ramberg et al, A probability Di
&gt; stribution
and its uses in fitting data, Technometrics, 1979".
The method uses a formula with 4 parameters and parameter values which generate
data of various degrees of skewness and kurtosis have been provided in the pape
&gt; r.
Only a few of those have been included in this program the command, but it can
easily be updated with more.
The included pairs of values are (sk,ku): (0,1.75), (0,3), (0,3.2), (0,3.3), (0
&gt; ,3.4),
(0,3.6), (0,4), (0,4.4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (0.5,3), (0.5,4), (
&gt; 0.5,5),
(0.5,6), (0.5,7), (0.5,8), (0.5,9), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (
&gt; 1,10),
(1.5,6), (1.5,7), (1.5,8), (1.5,9), (1.5,10), (1.5,11), (1.5,12), (2,9), (2,10)
&gt; , (2,11),
(2,12), (2,13), (2,14), (2,15),
For sk=2 and ku=9 the most extreme distribution is generated.
Negative skewness values can be inputted for left-skew distributions (the oppos
&gt; ite values
of the ones listed above)
