TITLE: `SURVSIM' : module to simulate survival/time-to-event data

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: survsim simulates survival data from a parametric distribution, 
a user-defined distribution, a cause-specific hazards competing risks model, a general 
multi-state model, or from an estimated -merlin- model. Baseline covariates and 
time-dependent effects can be specified when defining a data-generating model. 
Delayed entry/left truncation is allowed.
