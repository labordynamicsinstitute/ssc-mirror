{title:Description}
{pstd}The SCCS method examines the association between a time-varying exposure 
and an event outcome.{break}
The study samples onlyÂ cases, and it requires that an event has occurred during 
the observation period.{break}
The method doesn't compare incidences for cases with incidences for references.{break} 
Instead, it contrasts incidences in periods of risk with incidences in periods 
where the case is not at risk.{break}
In this approach, cases serve as their control for fixed confounders.{break}
It's feasible to adjust for time effects such as age.{break}
The intervals are marked by risk, time, and individual.{break}
For each interval, the number of incidences and the width of the interval are 
determined.

{title:Examples}

{phang}{bf:Case 3.1 in 2005 Whitaker}{break}
Hospital records indicate a association between MMR vaccination and viral meningitis.{break} 
Specifically, the use of a certain live mumps vaccine, known as the Urabe strain, 
has been linked to an increased risk of viral meningitis.{break}
Instances of viral meningitis were identified in 10 children during their second 
year of life. 
{p_end}

{phang}Get a dataset with an event day (day of meningitis) and a day for exposure
(day of vaccination):{p_end}
{phang}{stata `". use eventday exday using "https://sccs-studies.info/uploads/1/1/6/4/116436421/oxford.dta", clear"'}{p_end}
{phang}This dataset is readable from version 15.1. A version 12 dataset {it:sccsdta mmr.dta} with the same data is in the package.{p_end}

{phang}{bf:Case 3.1 in 2005 Whitaker continued}{break}
The observation period was from the 366th to the 730th day of age.{break}
Evidence led to the definition of the risk period as the 15th to the 35th day 
following the administration of the MMR vaccine.{break}
Age groups were 366 to 547 days and 548 to 730 days.{p_end}

{phang}Generate the SCCS dataset:{p_end}
{phang}{stata `". sccsdta eventday exday, enter(365) exit(730) riskpoints(14 35) timepoints(547)"'}{p_end}

{phang}We estimate the incidence rate ratio of the risk period versus the no 
risk period using a poisson regression and looking at the {it:i._exgr} estimate:{p_end}
{phang}{stata `". poisson _nevents i._exgr i._tmgr i._id, exposure(_interval) irr"'}{p_end}
{phang}Compare the {it:i._exgr} estimate with the Stata output at page 11 in 
2005 Whitaker.
{p_end}

{phang}We get a better estimate report using the command {help regmat:regmat} 
({cmd:ssc install matrixtools} - works for version 13.1){p_end}

{phang}{bf:Conclusion}{break}
The incidence rate in the risk period is around 12 times higher
than in the no-risk period.{break}
Hence, there is a a association between MMR vaccination and viral meningitis.{p_end}
