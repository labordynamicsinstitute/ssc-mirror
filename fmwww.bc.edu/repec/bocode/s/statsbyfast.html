<b><u>Collect statistics for a command across a by list -- faster</u></b>

<b>statsbyfast</b> is a direct replacement for <b>statsby</b>.  The only difference is one of
speed for large panel datasets.  The syntax is the same, see help statsby

The code for statsbyfast is a direct copy of <b>statsby</b> v.1.2.3 24Oct2002.  Only a
few lines were changed to alter the way by groups are identified -- using -in-
instead of -if-.  It appears that the only effect of these changes is a
dramatic (nearly 10x) speed increase when working with large panel data sets.
No ill side effects have been discovered.
