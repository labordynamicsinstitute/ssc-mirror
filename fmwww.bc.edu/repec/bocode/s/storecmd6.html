Store and repeat commands using characteristics
-----------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^storecmd6^ charname cmdline
<p>
    ^stowcmd6^ charname cmdline 
<p>
    ^repcmd6^ charname [ ^, s^howonly ] 
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
cmdline is any Stata command line.
<p>
charname is the name of a Stata characteristic. To avoid confusion with 
characteristics used by Stata itself, include at least one capital letter 
in the name. 
<p>
^storecmd6^ executes cmdline. If successful, meaning that there were no 
errors, cmdline is stored as characteristic ^_dta[^charname^]^. 
<p>
^stowcmd6^ stows away cmdline as characteristic ^_dta[^charname^]^. cmdline 
therefore need not be a command that would execute properly at the time
it is stowed. 
<p>
^repcmd6^ executes the command stored in characteristic 
^_dta[^charname^]^.
<p>
These commands with names ending with ^6^ are the original public domain 
Stata 6 versions of these commands, renamed. Users of Stata 7 up should 
use instead ^storecmd^, ^stowcmd^ and ^repcmd^. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^showonly^ shows the command line stored, but does not execute it. 
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
Stata command lines are stored temporarily in memory and they may 
be stored as desired in text files, commonly ^.log^ or ^.do^ files. 
<p>
These commands offer a third possibility: command lines may be stored 
as characteristics. They may be stored within sessions, and so long as 
the data file is saved so that these characteristics are included, they 
may be stored between sessions with the same data file. 
<p>
Here is one pattern: 
<p>
1. You develop a complicated command line, possibly after several steps. 
You want to store it. Type, for example, 
<p>
^storecmd6 G graph^ &lt;complicated details&gt; 
<p>
The command line 
<p>
^graph^ &lt;complicated details&gt; 
<p>
is executed. 
<p>
If no error occurs, the command line is stored as characteristic 
^_dta[G]^. 
<p>
In addition, the command line is placed in the keyboard buffer, 
so that it can be retrieved for editing. 
<p>
^storecmd6 G graph^ &lt;complicated details&gt; 
<p>
is one line above in the buffer. 
<p>
2. At any time, to see what commands have been stored, you can type 
<p>
^char list^ 
<p>
or 
<p>
^char list _dta^ 
<p>
noting that this will list any other characteristics as well. 
<p>
3. If you wish to save such characteristics with the data file, 
use the ^save^ command. 
<p>
4. Later, you wish to repeat the command. Type 
<p>
^repcmd6 G^ 
<p>
The command line stored as characteristic ^_dta[G]^ is executed. 
<p>
In addition, that command line is placed in the keyboard buffer, 
so that it can be retrieved for editing. 
<p>
^repcmd6 G^ 
<p>
is one line above in the buffer.
