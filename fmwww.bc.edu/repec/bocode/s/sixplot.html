    Title
<p>
<b><u> Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>sixplot</b><i>varlist</i> [<i>if</i>] [<i>in</i>]
<p>
<b><u> Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sixplot</b> displays six diagnostic and descriptive graphs for a single
    variable formatted as a 2 row, 3 column array.  The arguments are <i>varname</i>
    and <i>sequence variable</i>.  If no <i>sequence variable</i> is named, the program
    plots <i>varname</i> versus the sequence the data are stored in.
<p>
    The plot in the (1,1) position is a <b>sequence plot</b> of <i>varname</i> versus the
        sequence.
<p>
    The plot in the (1,2) position is a <b>residual versus fitted plot</b> of the
        regression of <i>varname</i> versus sequence.
<p>
    The plot in the (1,3) position is a <b>boxplot</b> of <i>varname</i>.
<p>
    The plot in the (2,1) position is a <b>first difference plot</b> of <i>varname</i>
        versus sequence.
<p>
    The plot in the (2,2) position is a <b>histogram</b> of <i>varname</i>.
<p>
    The plot in the (2,3) position is a <b>normal quantile plot</b> of <i>varname</i>.
<p>
    The default is to conduct these analyses for all observations in the data
    set in the order they are recorded.  If you sort the data, the analysis
    will be conducted on that order.
<p>
    The sequence plot allows you to examine the data for drift over the
    sequence (presumably time).  This graph also displays the linear fit line
    and a 95% forecast interval.  Observations outside the shaded line are
    candidates for inspection as outliers.  If you plot more than 300
    observations, the plot is blurred and I suggest you use batches of 300.
<p>
    The rvfplot displays the residuals versus the fitted values and allows
    you to check for outliers and patterns such as unequal variance over
    fitted values.  Clear patterns suggest you should look closely at your
    model. It also displays limits of 2*rmse as a guide.
<p>
    The boxplot shows quartiles and outliers.
<p>
    The first difference plot checks for changes in the data.
<p>
    The histogram provides a picture of the distribution of <i>varname</i>.  It has
    10 bins, which you may wish to change in further analysis.  It should be
    roughly symmetric if the data are normal.  Do not get overly concerned
    with apparent departures from symmetry if your data set is small.
<p>
    The normal quantile plot gives a graphical diagnostic of normality.  If
    the plot suggests non-normality, there may be concern about the validity
    of procedures such as confidence intervals.
<p>
    <b>Caution:</b>  If the data set is large, the sequence plot and the first
    difference plot may be blurred and difficult to interpret.  We suggest
    examining the data in batches of 300 or so using the <i>in 1/300</i> option.
    Sixplot does not superimpose a normal plot on the histogram.
<p>
<b><u> Examples</u></b>
<p>
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Setup
        <b>. sysuse uslifeexp.dta</b>
        <b>. sixplot le_male</b>
        <b>. sixplot le_female</b>
<p>
    The data set gives life expectancy by sex and race from 1900 to 1999.
    The above commands provide a sixplot for these years.
<p>
        Setup
    <b>. sysuse nlsw88.dta</b>
    <b>. sixplot wage</b>
<p>
    This data has over 2000 observations and blurs the information on the
    plots.  There is no obvious time relation here.
<p>
    <b>. sixplot wage in 1/300</b>
<p>
    The "in" restriction can be repeated as 301/600, etc.
<p>
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
    These plots were cited in Good and Hardin's book as the fourplot.  I have
    added the rvfplot and boxplot.  This seems to have originated in the
    <i>Engineering Statistics Handbook</i> section 4.4.5.3, from NIST (available
    online from www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/)
