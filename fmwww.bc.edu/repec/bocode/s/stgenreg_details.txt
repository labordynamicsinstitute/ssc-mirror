TITLE: `STGENREG' : module to fit general parametric survival models.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR: stgenreg fits parametric survival models using any user-defined [log] baseline hazard fuction. Gaussian quadrature is used to evaluate the 
cumulative hazard function and consequently the survival function allowing the estimation of a parametric survival model with almost any form. The [log] hazard 
function must be written in Mata code using colon operators. Each parameter defined in a [log] hazard function can include components, whereby each component 
can contain variables, user-defined functions of time, restricted cubic spline functions and/or fractional polynomial functions. Time-dependent effects can be 
included in any component. Relative survival models can also be fitted.
