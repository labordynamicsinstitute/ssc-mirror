<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sqset</b> -- Declare a dataset to be sequence data
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
    Declare data to be sequence data and specify element variable, the
    sequence identifier and sequence order (positions)
<p>
        <b>sqset</b> <i>elementvar idvar ordervar</i> [<b>, trim rtrim ltrim keeplongest</b> ]
<p>
    where <i>elementvar</i> is the variable that contains the elements of sequences,
    <i>idvar</i> is a variable that identifies the sequences, and <i>ordervar</i> is a
    variable that defines the order of the sequences.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sqset</b> declares the data to be sequence data and designates that
    <i>elementvar</i> represents the variable that represents the elements of the
    sequences, <i>idvar</i> should be an identifier of the sequences, and <i>ordervar</i>
    should be a variable that defines the order of each sequence.
<p>
    When using <b>sqset</b> various checks on the data are performed, and reported
    back to the user.
<p>
    <b>sqset</b> without arguments displays whether and how the dataset is currently
    set.
<p>
    <b>sqset, clear</b> is a rarely used to erase the settings from the data.
<p>
    To use <b>sqset</b>, sequence data has to be in long format. Use <b>reshape</b> to
    change sequence data in wide format to sequence data in long format.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>trim</b> means both, <b>ltrim</b> and <b>rtrim</b>. Generally, we recommend using this
        option.
<p>
    <b>rtrim</b> erases empty elements at the end of the sequences. Sequence data
        that stem from data in wide format often contain missing values at
        the end of sequences. Generally, there is no need for these
        observations, so that they can simply be erased without loss of
        information.
<p>
    <b>ltrim</b> strips all empty elements at the beginning of the sequences.
        Generally, all sequences should start with the element at the first
        position. In practice, sequence data sometimes have one or more empty
        elements at the beginning, which we call "gaps at the beginning".
        Gaps at the beginning are very common for sequence data that has its
        origins in unbalanced cross-sectional time-series data (see xt). The
        SQ-Ados slightly differ in how they deal with gaps at the beginning.
        Gaps at the beginning are, however, somewhat ill-treated, as this
        means that a sequence does not start at the first position. <b>ltrim</b>
        changes the sequence data in such a way that all sequences starts at
        position one. The dataset is changed by the option <b>ltrim</b>.
<p>
    <b>keeplongest</b> keeps only the longest section of a sequence with unknown
        elements at specific positions. Generally, a missing value at a
        certain position in a sequence is just another element, so there is
        no specific technical problem. For some commands (i.e., <b>sqom</b>), it is
        however necessary to consider how similar the missing value is with
        each of the other elements of a sequence. The answer to this cannot
        be given by the SQ-Ados themselves. In order to point the user to
        such problems, <b>sqset</b> checks for missing elements and provides a note.
        The note points the user to the option <b>keeplongest</b>. <b>sqset</b> with
        <b>keeplongest</b> will force Stata to keep only the longest available
        section of a sequence that contains missings. If several sections of
        a sequence have the same, Stata will randomly select one of them. The
        dataset is changed by the option <b>keeplongest</b>, and that <b>keeplongest</b> is
        only one of several ways to deal with missing elements in a sequence
        (see sq).
