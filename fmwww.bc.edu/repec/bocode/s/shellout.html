<b>help shellout</b>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> -- Opens documents and their programs from inside Stata.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Multiple Syntax</u></b>
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> <i>application</i> [, cd]
    where <i>application</i> is the name of a software application to be opened.
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> [using] <i>filename</i> [, cd]
    where <i>filename</i> takes the form of a document with a known extension, such
    as .doc, .do, .dta, .txt, .xls, .xml, etc.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
    <b>cd</b> should not be used, except to tell Stata that the program in question
    is located in the current directory.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> opens a document from inside Stata without having to specify the
    exact file path of the program. It also opens an application with or
    without specifying a file document to be opened.
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> is a shell wrapper designed for Windows XP/NT. Unlike shell,
    implements a nested DOS command. The DOS Window is told to close itself.
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> was originally written to accompany <b>outreg2</b> for automatic
    opening of non-Stata documents.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> wsestata.exe
    <b>shellout</b> using myfile.xml
    <b>shellout</b> using "c:\myfolder\myfile.doc"
    <b>shellout</b> myfile.xml
    <b>shellout</b> me.do
<p>
    The first line will open another Stata executable.
    The second line will open a document named myfile.xml in Excel.
    The third line will open a document named myfile.doc in Word.
    The fourth line will do the same thing without invoking the "using"
    syntax.
    The fifth line is the equivalent of -do me- in another Stata executable,
    or was it -run me-....
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Parameters</u></b>
<p>
    A parameter is any value passed into a batch script. <b>shellout</b> will work
    with parameters in the following examples (assuming you have Stata SE)
<p>
    <b>shellout</b> shellout wsestata.exe shellout wsestata.exe shellout
        wsestata.exe
    <b>shellout</b> wsestata di "Bite Me"
    <b>shellout</b> notepad "Bite Me"
<p>
    The first line will open three Stata executables in a daisy-chain.
    The second line will open a Stata executable with a "Bite Me" message.
    The third line will open a (new) notepad file called "Bite Me".
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Advanced Parameters</u></b>
<p>
    You can save a batch of parameters in a file and invoke it under <b>shellout</b>
    much like calling upon a do-file. Learn some DOS commands if you want to
    implement it.
