Description
-----------
<p>
^stgtcalc^ calculates local estimates of the regression coefficients in the Cox
model most recently fitted for using @stcox@.
<p>
^stgtplot^ plots the estimates and confidence intervals against the failure
times. varlist is (a subset of) the independent variables in model fitted by
^stcox^.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^ci^ causes a ^level()^% confidence band to be plotted around the estimates of 
&gt; the
    regression coefficients. The pointwise confidence intervals are derived
    from the running line smoother @running@.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ sets the width of a pointwise confidence band for the estimated
    b(t). Default: current value of system macro ^$S_level^ (usually 95%).
<p>
^mean^ uses the ^mean^ option of @running@ to produce a running mean smoother.
<p>
graph_options are any of Stata's ^graph, twoway^ options
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^stgtcalc^ implements a suggestion of Grambsch and Therneau (1994). For an xvar
with estimated regression coefficient b, ^stgtcalc^ calculates 
<p>
        g(T) = b + #deaths * V^^-1 * r(T)
<p>
at each failure time T, where V is the estimated dispersion matrix of the
regression coefficients, #deaths is the number of uncensored observations and
r(T) is the vector of Schoenfeld residuals at T. The g(T)'s are smoothed and
the smoothed values are saved. g(T) is a local estimate of beta, so the shape
of the smoothed profile may indicate whether beta depends on time. If so, the
dataset has non-proportional hazards and the model will need to be refined.
<p>
Note that the smoothed g(T) may be unreliable in the initial and final phases
of follow-up.  This may be partly due to lack of robustness in the smoother.
<p>
The values of g(T) for each xvar are saved with names ^GT^xvar1, ^GT^xvar2, etc
&gt; .
<p>
If more than one xvar is to be plotted by ^stgtplot^, a panel of plots is produ
&gt; ced.
