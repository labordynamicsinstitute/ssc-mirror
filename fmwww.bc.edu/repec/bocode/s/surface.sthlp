{title:Description}

{pstd}
The function attempts to draw a wireframe plot from three variables.
{it:Var1} specifies the x-coordinate, {it:var2} the y-coordinate and {it:var3} the 
z-coordinate. Alternatively the function can draw a circle at each 
point and add a straight line going 
down to the lowest point.

{pstd}
This function can handle data that is not in the form of a matrix of values.
However if there are too many x- and y- values the function will attempt 
to {it:round} the dataset values into a more reasonable spread of values. This 
will result in very messy figures. However in such a case it is the 
impression that is needed. Many other statistical packages require a full 
matrix of values. This is not a problem using the {it:nowire} option.

{pstd}
At present the state of rotating the diagram is limited to interchanging the 
axes.

{title:Options}

{phang}
{cmdab:saving}{cmd:(}{it:filename} {it:[, replace ]}{cmd:)} this will save the resulting graph in filename.gph. If the file already exists then use the {it:replace} suboption.

{phang}
{cmdab:nowire} this suppresses the drawing of the wire frame in exchange for lines 

{phang}
{cmdab:round}{cmd:(}{it:#}{cmd:)}, data is automatically rounded if there are too many x and y values. This option controls the amount of rounding, for example round(1) rounds the x and y values to the nearest integer.

{phang}
{opt labelround}(#) specifies the precision of the x, y and z automatic axes labels. {p_end}

{phang}
{cmdab:orient}{cmd:(}{it:string} {cmd:)} this function must take the letters xyz or a combination of them. Whichever letter comes first is the x-axis, second is y-axis and third is 
the z-axis. Thus {bf:orient(zxy)} means that {it:var1} is now the y coordinates, {it:var2} 
is the z-coordinates and {it:var3} is the x-coordinates. This is different from 
changing the variables around since the wireframe is still draw across the 
original x and y values. This is a crude attempt to implement rotation to 
obtain a clearer picture.

{phang}
{cmdab:xtitle}{cmd:(}{it:string}{cmd:)} specifies the title for the X-axis, the default is "X-axis"

{phang}
{cmdab:ytitle}{cmd:(}{it:string}{cmd:)} specifies the title for the Y-axis, the default is "Y-axis"

{phang}
{cmdab:ztitle}{cmd:(}{it:string}{cmd:)} specifies the title for the Z-axis, the default is "Z-axis"

{phang}
{cmdab:xlabel}{cmd:(}{it:numlist}{cmd:)} specifies the labelling on the X-axis.

{phang}
{cmdab:ylabel}{cmd:(}{it:numlist}{cmd:)} specifies the labelling on the Y-axis.

{phang}
{cmdab:zlabel}{cmd:(}{it:numlist}{cmd:)} specifies the labelling on the Z-axis.

{title:Examples}

{phang}
{inp:surface x y z, saving(myfile) round(10) orient(zxy) }

{phang}
{inp:surface x y z, xtitle(my x title) ytitle(my y title) ztitle(my z title) saving(myfile,replace)}
