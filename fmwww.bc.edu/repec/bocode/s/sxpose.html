<b><u>Transpose of string variable dataset</u></b>
<p>
        <b>sxpose, clear</b> [<b>force format(</b><i>format</i><b>) firstnames destring</b>]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sxpose</b> transposes a dataset of string variables, so that observations
    become variables, and vice versa. It is a rough and ready utility: use
    circumspectly.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sxpose</b> is destructive. Your existing dataset will disappear. The
    compulsory <b>clear</b> option is intended to remind you of that.
<p>
    The number of variables allowed in Stata is very much less than the
    number of observations allowed. See help on limits. In addition, with
    even moderate numbers of observations, you may run into memory problems
    when trying to transpose a dataset.  See help on memory.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>clear</b> is a required option, flagging that you are aware that the current
    dataset will be cleared from memory.
<p>
    <b>force</b> specifies that the transpose should go ahead even though the
    dataset contains numeric variables. Numeric values will be coerced to
    string using the format %12.0g or whatever numeric format is specified by
    the <b>format()</b> option. You may lose some precision, especially in
    non-integer values, when you do this.
<p>
    <b>format()</b> specifies a numeric format to use in coercing numeric values to
    string. See above.
<p>
    <b>firstnames</b> specifies that the first variable (first column) in the
    existing dataset is to be treated as a set of variable names for the
    variables in the transposed dataset. This first column will not appear as
    the first observation in the new dataset. Any values that are not legal
    variable names will be lost.
<p>
    <b>destring</b> specifies that <b>destring, replace</b> will be run on the new dataset
    in an attempt to convert variables that are unambiguously numeric in
    content to numeric. No force will be applied.  See help on destring.
