d 'SDID_EVENT': module providing Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) event-study estimators
d
d      sdid_event computes the event-study version of the Synthetic
d Difference-in-Differences (SDID) estimators from Arkhangelsky   
d et al. (2021). As the name suggests, this program is an extension
d of sdid. As a result, all the conventions and requirement    for
d the implementation of sdid also apply for sdid_event. sdid_event
d can also be used in staggered adoption designs, with	 
d differential timing of treatment adoption. Also, the command
d supports both the bootstrap and placebo vce() options for   
d inference.
