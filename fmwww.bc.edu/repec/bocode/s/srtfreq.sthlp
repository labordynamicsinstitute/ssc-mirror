{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:srtfreq} Performs analysis of educational trials under the assumption of independent errors among pupils; this can also be used with schools as fixed effects.
The analysis produces {cmd:Effect Size} (ES) estimates for both conditional and unconditional model specifications in Simple Randomised Trials. It also allows for sensitivity analysis options such as permutations
and bootstraps.


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Model}

{phang}
{opt seed(#)} Sets seed number for permutations/bootstraps.

{phang}
{opt nperm(#)} Specifies number of permutations required to generate permutated p-values; see Stored results.  
If specified with {cmd:paste}, a list of generated variables attaches to the user's dataset containing the permutated effect sizes. 

{phang}
{opt nboot(#)} Specifies number of bootstraps required to generate the bootstrap confidence intervals. 
If specified with {cmd:paste}, a list of generated variables attaches to the user's dataset containing the bootstrapped effect sizes.

{phang}
{opt perc:entile} Specifies use of the percentile bootstrap confidence interval. {p_end}

{phang}
{opt basic} Specifies use of the basic (Hall's) bootstrap confidence interval; default is percentile. {p_end}


{dlgtab:Reporting}

{phang}
{opt noisily} Displays the permutated/bootstrapped conditional models' regression results as they occur.
 
{phang}
{opt nodot} Suppresses display of dots indicating progress of permutations/bootstraps. Default is one dot character displayed for every block of 10 replications. {p_end}

{phang}
{opt paste} Attaches bootstrapped or permutated effect sizes to existing dataset if nperm (PermC/Unc_I#) or nboot (BootC/Unc_I#) has been specified, 
where I# denotes number of interventions and C/Unc denotes Conditional/Unconditional estimates. Existing variables generated from previous use are replaced. {p_end}
