Create a dataset suitable for case-cohort analysis

<p>
^stcascoh^ is for use with survival-time data; see help @st@. You must ^stset^ 
&gt; data with
an ^id()^ variable before using this command; see help @stset@.
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^stcascoh^ is used to create the appropriate dataset for a case-cohort analysis
&gt;  by
sampling the cohort at the time of entry (subcohort) and including all failures
&gt; , whether they occur in
the random sample or not (non subcohort cases). To this aim, ^stcascoh^ expands
&gt;  the observations who fail in two
parts: (1) time interval (t0,t-eps]  and  (2) time interval (t-eps,t].
The following variables are added to the dataset:
<p>
^ _subco^    coded  0  for subcohort member with no failure
                  1  for subcohort members who failed
                  2  for non subcohort cases
^ _wBarlow^  log-weights of records as in Barlow scheme
^ _wSelPre^  log-weights of records as in Self and Prentice scheme.
<p>
The names of the new variables can be changed by specifying the ^gen()^ option.
varlist defines the variables to be retained in the final dataset. If varlist i
&gt; s not specified, all variables
are carried over into the resulting dataset.
<p>
^stcascoh^ shows two summary tables: the first one describes the subcohort memb
&gt; ership
vs. failure in the cohort; the second displays the risk sets with three control
&gt; s or less
to check whether the subcohort becomes small due to many failures or censorings
&gt; .
<p>
In the new dataset, non-subcohort cases cannot rely on the original ^stset^ dec
&gt; laration.
At the end of the module, ^stset^ is invoked  to fix entry and exit time to the
&gt;  present
_t0 and _t variables.
<p>
Randomness in the sampling is obtained using Stata uniform() function. Seed can
&gt;  be specified
by a ^seed()^ option. Observations not meeting ^if^ and ^in^ criteria are dropp
&gt; ed even if
they fail.
<p>
The resulting dataset can be analyzed using ^stselpre^ or ^stcox^.
^stselpre^ fits proportional hazards model according with Prentice and Self-Pre
&gt; ntice methods. 
Self-Prentice model based variance is estimated.
When using ^stcox^, ^robust^ option is needed to estimate the approximate varia
&gt; nce as proposed by Lin
and Ying and Barlow. In this case, analysis can be performed using three method
&gt; s:
<p>
1- Prentice: ^stcox varlist, robust^
2- Self and Prentice: ^stcox varlist, offset(_wSelPre) robust^
3- Barlow: ^stcox varlist, offset(_wBarlow) robust^
<p>
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^alpha(^#^)^ specifies the sampling fraction. Sampling fraction can be expresse
&gt; d as real or
    integer.
<p>
^group(^varlist^)^ specifies that the ^alpha^ sample is to be drawn within each
&gt;  set of values
    of varlist, thus maintaining the proportion of each group. 
<p>
^generate(^varlist^)^ specifies variable names for three generated variables.
<p>
^eps(^#^)^ specifies a typically small number so that a case that is in the ris
&gt; k at time
    set  at t is represented in the expanded data by an "infinitesimal" episode
&gt;  (t-eps,t].
    ^eps^ should be set to a number that is small compared to the measurement u
&gt; nit of time.
    ^eps^ defaults to 1E-3.       
<p>
^seed(^#^)^ specifies seed for random sampling.
<p>
^noshow^ prevents ^stcascoh^ from showing the names of the key ^st^ variables.
<p>
<p>
<p>
Tip: if the cohort has already been sampled
-------------------------------------------
<p>
^stcascoh^ can be used to prepare the dataset for case-cohort analysis when the
&gt;  cohort 
has been previously sampled. The steps are as follows:
<p>
1) Divide the data set in two files: the first one for subcohort observations, 
&gt; the second for additional cases.
<p>
2) Appropriately -stset- the new files.
<p>
3) Process the subcohort file with -stcascoh- setting alpha just below 1 (i.e. 
&gt; .999) and save this file.
   Do some assert to verify that _subco _wSelpre are coded as you expect.
<p>
4) Process the additional cases file with -stcascoh- setting alpha = 0 and save
&gt;  this second file.
   Also for this file some -assert- is appropriate to verify that _subco _wSelp
&gt; re are coded as you expect.
<p>
5) Append the two files you generated.
<p>
6) Adapt the Barlow weights. Suppose you sampled 1000 out of 16000 subjects. Yo
&gt; u should type
   ^replace _wBarlow=ln(16000/1000) if _wBarlow&gt;0^
