Stereotype Ordered Regression 
-----------------------------
<p>
soreg depvar varlist [if exp] [in range] [,Maxdim(integer 1) 
      Constraints(clist)]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
soreg implements the stereotype ordinal regression model proposed by 
Anderson. Constraints may be defined to perform constrained
estimation.   
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^maxdim^ defines the dimension of the stereotype model to be fitted
<p>
^constraints(^clist^)^ specifies the linear constraints to be applied
    during estimation.  The default is to perform unconstrained
    estimation.  Constraints are defined with the constraint command.
    constraints(1) specifies that the model is to be constrained
    according to constraint 1; constraints(1-4) specifies constraints
    1 through 4; constraints(1-4,8) specifies 1 through 4 and 8.  It
    is not considered an error to specify nonexistent constraints as
    long as some of the constraints exist.  Thus, constraint(1-999)
    would specify that all defined constraints be applied.

Remarks
-------
<p>
Stereotype ordinal regression is an alternative to the proportional
odds ordinal regression implemented by ologit.
