d 'SEG': module to compute multiple-group diversity and segregation indicesdd SEG calculates a variety of indices to measure diversity andd mutual  segregation among multiple groups. A 'by' option allowsd the calculation of the  indices within different organizationald levels, and a Unit option allows calculation	of the indicesd between different organizational levels. Generate and Filed options  allow the indices to be output to either the currentd data set or a new data set.  This is version 2.00 of thed software, and runs under Stata 6 or Stata 7. dd Author: Sean F.
