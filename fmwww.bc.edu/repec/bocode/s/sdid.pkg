d 'SDID': module to perform synthetic difference-in-differences estimation, inference, and visualization
d
d  The sdid command implements the synthetic
d difference-in-differences method of Arkhangelsky et al. (AER,
d 2021) for Stata. The program generates the ATT estimate derived
d in Arkhangelsky et al. (2021), and conducts inference following
d their bootstrap, placebo, or jackknife methods. The command
d allows for multiple treatment dates and multiple treatment units
d directly, as well as cases with only a single treatment unit.  As
d well as estimation and inference, the sdid command includes a
d number of graphical output options to summarize the synthetic
d difference-in-differences estimator.
