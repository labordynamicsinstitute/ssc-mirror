Then^streg^ with ^exponential^, ^weibull^ or ^gompertz^ distribution has to bepreviously specified; see help @streg@.Description-----------When used without options ^stcoxgof^ shows a two by ten table presentingthe observed and expected numbers of events in each decile of risk.According to May and Hosmer z-score and two-tailed p-value from standardnormal distrubution are also tabulated. If ^plot^ option is given Arjasplots by quantiles of risk are displayed.Options-------^group(^#^)^ specifies the number of quantiles of risk to be used to group    observed ed expected numbers of events. Default is 10. Values allowed    are from 4 to 10.^gen(^string^)^ supplies the name of a new variable to hold the quantiles of    risk indicators. Including this variable as design variables you can    estimate likelihood ratio test for the fitted proportional hazard model.^poidis^ estimates the probability of observed counts within each decile of    risk according to Poisson distibution with mean equal to the estimated    expected number of counts.^plot(^#^)^ specifies the number of quantiles of risk used to group the    data for Arjas plots. Values allowed are from 2 to 10. If more than 6    quantiles of risk are used, two combined plots are displayed. To    implement this option ^forgraph^ (STB-49: gr36) is called. See help    @net@ to install user-written additions from the net.^separate^ requests that for each quantile of risk a separate graph should    be shown.^saving(^filename^,^[^replace^]^)^ saves graph(s) in file(s) that can be    reviewed by ^graph using^ and printed.    Examples--------        . ^stcoxgof^        . ^stcoxgof, gr(5)^        . ^stcoxgof, plot(4)^        . ^stcoxgof, gen(decile)^        . ^stcoxgof, poidis^         . ^stcoxgof, plot(8) sa(Arjas,replace)^Also see-------- Manual:  ^[R] stcox^On-line:  help for @stcox@; Reference---------Hosmer DW,jr and Lemeshow S: Applied Survival Analysis (1999) p. 225 - 230.                             John Wiley & Sons - New York.
