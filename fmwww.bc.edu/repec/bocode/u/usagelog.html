<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>Usagelog</b> is designed for programmers who want to keep track of how often
    and, simply, how their program is being used by their users.  With
    <b>usagelog</b> you can log the date and time of day the program was started and
    completed as well as what the user's command line looked like and any
    user-error code.  This one program can be used to track several programs
    in different usage log files.  When used with the option etime it can
    report how long the program to took to run in days:hours:mins:secs.
<p>
    The first line in the usagelog file is:
<p>
        "Current date", "Current time" and "Work directory"
<p>
        "Current date" is taken from the creturn variable: <b>`c(current_date)'</b>
<p>
        "Current time" is taken from the creturn variable: <b>`c(current_time)'</b>
<p>
        "Work directory" is taken from the creturn variable: <b>`c(pwd)'</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>start</b> specifies that <b>usagelog</b> is to start logging program.
<p>
    <b>message</b> can pass any text message to the usagelog file like what options
        and settings the user of the program submitted.
<p>
    <b>type</b> specifies the program name or any text string you want the
        {cmd:usagelog file to start with.
<p>
    <b>etime</b> specifies to add the elapsed time since <b>start</b> to the usage log
        file.
<p>
    <b>uerror</b> provides what error code you want documented at time the program
        exited.  You have to make a call to <b>usagelog</b> before the Stata program
        really crashes since Stata will likely stop at that time.  <b>Uerror</b> is
        only helpful when you can predict how the program might fail.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    You can make a call to <b>usagelog</b> at the beginning of a program:
<p>
        <b>usagelog</b> , type(savasas) c(savasas using `using' `if' `in' ,
        type(`type') `replace' `rename')
<p>
        and then at the end of the program call it again:
<p>
        <b>usagelog</b> , type(savasas) uerror(5) etime(`s(etime)')
