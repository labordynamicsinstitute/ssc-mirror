However, the output includes a five-numberd summary (minimum, 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles,  and maximum)d normally available only with the detail option of summarize. Thisd is version 1.1.2 of univar, updating the version in STB-36, asd corrected in Statalist Digest v3n249. dd Author: John R.
