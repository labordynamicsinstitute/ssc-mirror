Unique values of a variable or group of variables
-------------------------------------------------
<p>
^unique^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range], ^by(^varname^) gen^erate^(^varname^) 
&gt; d^etail
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
The command ^unique^ without a ^by^ reports the number of unique values for
the varlist. With a ^by^ it does the same, but also creates a new
variable (^_Unique^ by default but can be named in the ^gen^ option). This new
variable contains the number of unique values of the varlist for each level
of the ^by^ variable. The new variable is coded missing except for the first
record in each group defined by the levels of the ^by^ variable.
<p>
The command is useful for exploring data where the records refer to
more than one level, for example longitudinal data where each record
refers to a visit by a subject.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^by^ provides the name of a categorical variable.
<p>
^generate()^ supplies the name of the new variable which contains the
number of unique values of the varlist by levels defined by the
categorical variable supplied in the ^by^.
<p>
^detail^ request summary statistics on the number of records which are
present for unique values of the varlist. If you have longitudinal data
for instance, this option reports the mean, median, minimum and maximum number
of visits per subject.
<p>
Example
-------
<p>
Consider a longitudinal data set in which each record corresponds to a
visit by a subject. The subject identity is in the variable id, and
the visit is identified by the variable visit, within id. Then
<p>
^unique id^
<p>
reports the number of subjects
<p>
^unique id visit^
<p>
reports a number which will be the same as the number of records unless
there are duplicate records with the same id and visit number.
<p>
^unique visit, by(id) gen(vno)^
<p>
creates a new variable at the subject level which contains the number of
visits for that subject. Alternatively
<p>
^unique id, detail^
<p>
reports summary statistics for the number of visits per subject.
