<b><u>Notes</u></b>
<p>
The Federal Reserve System website has a slow but relatively good Data Download
&gt;  Program.
It provides several possibilities but it does not provide an inventory index to
&gt;  programmatically
know what's available. This is a usual weakness of this type of service. The EC
&gt; B has a similarly 
good system (which like <b> federalreserve.gov</b> supports SDMX) but suffers from hav
&gt; ing no 
inventory index as well.
This means it is hard to program the data API and can only do so statically. Th
&gt; at's why 
we download the entire series every time and that's why we only do daily rates 
&gt; and not 
monthly or annual. We do leave the year month and date so the user can produce 
&gt; easily produce 
weekly, monthly or annual averages.
<p>
The stata links above tell you what it is you are downloading. For example <b> usd</b>
<b>&gt;  EUR</b> will give you US dollars per euro
whereas <b> usd CHF</b> will give you Swiss francs per US dollar.
<p>
The usual disclaimers apply. I wrote this for myself because I experiment with 
&gt; data which I need to 
get fresh and fast from diverse sources. I put it out for fun. Use at your own 
&gt; risk.

We return all the labels we get from the provisioning service so consult<b> return</b>
