Left-justifying string variables for output
-------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^ljs^ varlist
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^ljs^ takes each string variable within varlist and left-justifies it by
trimming leading and trailing spaces and padding with as many spaces on
the right as are needed to make each value exactly the same length.
<p>
The result may be useful for listing or outfiling. However, it is not
recommended that variables are saved in this form.
<p>
Example
-------
<p>
    . ^ljs make^
