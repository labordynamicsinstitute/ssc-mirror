<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    Featured list of ado-files
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
        <b>lado</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] <b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>
<p>
    where <i>stub</i> may be a dot, a single letter or any combination of characters
    that can be used for file names, or a dot followed by a single letter of
    any combination of characters that can be used for file names.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>lado</b> is developed for ado file programmers. It returns a list of ado
    files stored in the working directory or in any other directory that has
    been set as the "ado development folder". If <i>stub</i> is specified, only
    files with names containing<i> stub</i> are listed. Along with the file names,
    the programs offer a list of click-able links for some typical tasks that
    one wants to do for <i>own</i> ado files.
<p>
    Specifically, <b>lado</b> provides links for viewing and editing each ado file.
    If a help file exists links for getting help and editing the help file
    are also provided.
<p>
    By default, the Stata do-file editor is invoked for editing ado files and
    help files. However, you can use a different editor by setting the global
    macro "MYEDITOR" to the command that opens your preferred text editor. I,
    for example, have the line
<p>
        ------------------- profile.do
        <b>global MYEDITOR !emacsclient -n</b>
        -------------------------------
<p>
    in my profile file, which works under Linux. Windows users might prefer
    something along the following lines
<p>
        -------------------- profile.do
        <b>global MYEDITOR winexec textpad</b>
        -------------------------------
<p>
    Note that setting the macro MYEDITOR also affects the editor used to open
    do-files with ldo and the editor used to open tex-files with ltex.
<p>
    By default, <b>lado</b> lists the ado files in the working directory. However,
    you can predefine an <b>ado development directory</b> which is then used instead
    of the working directory.  This is done by setting the global macro
    "ADODEVELOPMENT" to the directory in which own ado files are created. I
    have
<p>
        ------------------------ profile.do
        <b>global ADODEVELOPMENT "~/ado/cooker/"</b>
        -----------------------------------
<p>
    in my profile file.
<p>
    The ado development folder can be overwritten interactively by typing a
    dot in front of or instead of the stub. The command
<p>
        <b>. lado .</b>
<p>
    will list all ado files of your current directory even if you have
    predefined an ado development folder. Likewise,
<p>
        <b>. lado .l</b>
<p>
    will list all ado files of your current directory starting with the
    letter l.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b> brings up yet another click-able item which allows to erase files
        on disk. Clicking on that item removes the respective file
        immediately from the disk. The file is not moved to the recycle bin.
        The erase button is printed in red to indicate that it should be
        handled with care.

<b><u>Example</u></b>

        <b>. lado, erase</b>
