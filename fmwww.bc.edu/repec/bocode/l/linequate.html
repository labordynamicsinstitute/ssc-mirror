<b><u>Title</u></b>
    <b>linequate</b> -- Calculates linear equating constants A &amp; B using Tucker and
        Levine's equal and unequal reliability methods.

<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
        <b>linequate</b> <i>anchortest</i> <i>newtest</i> <i>oldtest</i>

    Note: Error variances used in the Levine Methods are estimated using
      Angoff's method (see Peterson, Cook, &amp; Stocking, 1983).

<b><u>Description</u></b>
    Calculates linear equating constants A &amp; B needed to equate a new test
    (X) to an old test (Y) using an anchor test.  The linear equating
    constants are to be applied to transform scores using the following
    equation: T(x)=Ax+B, where x represents the scores to be transformed and
    T(x) represents the transformed scores.  This command uses three methods:
    Tucker, Levine's equal reliability method, and Levine's unequal
    reliability method (see Peterson, Cook, &amp; Stocking, 1983).

<b><u>Results</u></b>
    Results are printed in the results window. The equating constants are
    also stored in the following scalars r(tae), r(tb), r(La), r(Lb), r(LUa),
    and r(Lub). The number of observations for each linking group is also
    printed as Nya (the number of students who took the anchor and old form
    of the test), Nxa (the number of students who took the anchor and the new
    form of the test, and Na (the number of students who took the anchor
    test).
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
    If the application of the formulas for the linear equating constancts
    involve imaginary numbers, such as the square root of a negative number,
    a blank result will print.
