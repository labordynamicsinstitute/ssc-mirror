<b><u>Check linearity of continuous covariate</u></b>
<p>
        <b>lincheck</b> <i>full GLM command</i>
<p>
<p>
    The continuous covariate to be checked for linearity must be
    first in the list of independent variables.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>lincheck</b> provides a quick-and-dirty check of whether a continuous
    covariate in a general linearized model (GLM) is linear in the
    link function.  <b>lincheck</b> makes a new categorical variable that
    breaks the continuous covariate into quartiles, then re-estimates
    the GLM using dummy variables for the quartiles, and finally
    provides a graph of estimated coefficients plotted against the
    midpoints (actually: medians) of the quartiles. A linear graph
    supports the assumption of linearity of the continuous covariate.
    <b>lincheck</b> works with most GLM commands such as regress,
    logit/logistic, probit, poisson, stcox etc. and their
    svy-versions.

<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>lincheck</b> implements a method suggested by Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow
    (Applied Logistic Regression, 2nd ed., 2000, Wiley, p.99f).  Its
    reason of existence is the fact that linearity of a continuous
    covariate can be checked in the presence of other covariates in
    the model. If the graph is not linear, the continuous covariate
    might have to enter the model linearized.  <b>fracpoly</b> can be used
    to suggest appropriate transformations. Indeed, Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow
    recommend to use <b>fracpoly</b> in any case, since its results might
    not always agree with those of <b>lincheck</b>, and the question of
    linearity should be assessed in the light of the results of both
    methods.

<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. lincheck logit smoker age sex weight if syst_bp&gt;120, nolog or</b>
    <b>. lincheck xi:logit smoker age sex i.race, nolog</b>
    <b>. lincheck stcox weight sex</b>
    <b>. lincheck svyprobit smoker weight age sex</b>
<p>
      The first two examples test linearity for 'age', the others test
      linearity for 'weight'.
