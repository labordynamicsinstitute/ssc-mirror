<b><u>Multistate Life Expectancy Calculator</u></b>
<p>
        <b>lxpct_2</b> [<b>,</b> <b><u>i</u></b><b>(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <b><u>d</u></b><b>(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b>]
<p>
    where <b>i</b> is the total number of states in the model (absorbing states and
    non-absorbing states)
<p>
    and <b>d</b> is the number of absorbing states (e.g. death).
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>lxpct_2</b> calculates multistate life expectancies from age-specific
    transition probabilities.  Like a standard life table, the multistate, or
    increment-decrement, life table allows a researcher to calculate expected
    years of life while adjusting for age-related differences in the
    composition of various populations.
<p>
        The input file must contain the following variables:
<p>
        <u>Variable name</u>    <u>Details</u>
<p>
        age               Age 'x' in single years
        pij               Transition probability from state `i' at age `x' to
                            state `j' at age `x+1'
<p>
<p>
        For example in a model with the states disabled, non-diabled, and
        dead, the total number of states in the model is three (i.e. <b><u>i</u></b><b>(3)</b> )
        and the total number of non-absorbing states is one (i.e. <b><u>d</u></b><b>(1)</b> ).  An
        appropriately structured dataset would take the following shape*:
<p>
            age      p11       p12       p13       p21       p22       p23

<p>
        Notice that no transition probabilites are needed for transitions
        from absorbing to non-aborbing states and that no transition
        probablities are needed for remaining within an absorbing state (i.e.
        I assume the dead remain dead).  The program automatically sets the
        former to 0 and the later to 1.

<b><u>Results</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>lxpct_2</b> command calculates and displays, by age, the life table
    functions which have been stored as matrices. These entail the following:
<p>
        li_x     the survival function in state `i' at age `x'
        Li_x     the person-years in state `i' at age `x'
        Ti_x     the reverse-cumulative function of Li_x in state `i' at age
        `x'
        ei_x     the life expectancy in state `i' at age `x'
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Example</u></b>
<p>
    A calcuation of multistate life table expectancies using the model and
    dataset described above involves the following syntax :
<p>
        . lxpct_2, i(3) d(1)
<p>
    The program calculates the matrices l1_x, l2_x, l3_x, L1_x, L2_x, L3_x,
    T1_x, T2_x, T3_x, e1_x, e2_x, and e3_x.  These matrices can be transposed
    into variables using the command <b>svmat</b>.  For example:
<p>
        . svmat e2_x, names(col)
<p>
    The variables can then be manipulated within Stata using such commands as
    <b>summarize</b> and <b>graph</b>, or they can be exported into another software
    package for manipulation.
