d 'LPDID': module implementing Local Projections Difference-in-Differences (LP-DiD) estimator
d
d  LPDID performs the Local Projections Difference-in-Differences
d estimator (LP-DiD) proposed by Dube, Girardi, Jord√† and Taylor
d (2023). LP-DiD is a convenient and flexible regression-based
d framework for implementing Difference-in-Differences with
d multiple time periods. It uses panel data to estimate the average
d effect of a treatment under the assumptions of no-anticipation
d and (conditional) parallel trends. It can provide both dynamic
d event study estimates that track the treatment effect path at
d each time horizon after treatment, and 'pooled' estimates of the
d overall average effect in a post-treatment time window. Treatment
d can be absorbing (once a unit gets treated, it stays treated) or
d non-absorbing (units can enter and exit treatment multiple
d times). If treatment is non-absorbing, the nonabsorbing() option
d must be specified. The estimation sample is restricted to units
d entering treatment and 'clean' controls, thus avoiding the
d 'negative-weights' bias of TWFE estimators. The baseline version
d estimates a variance-weighted effect with strictly positive
d weights. The reweighed version (implemented through the rw
d option) estimates an equally-weighted average effect. LP-DiD
d offers flexibility in using either the last period before
d treatment (the default option) or an average of pre-treatment
d periods (the pmd() option) as the pre-treatment base period. The
d command allows inclusion of control variables, including
d pre-treatment lags of the outcome.
