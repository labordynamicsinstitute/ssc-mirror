Copy value labels 
-----------------
<p>
    ^labcopy^ valuelabelname [ ^, f^rom^(^numlist^) t^o^(^numlist^) l^ist ] 
<p>
    ^labcopy^ valuelabelname [ ^, s^wap^(^#1 #2^) l^ist ]  
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^labcopy^ copies specified value labels from value label valuelabelname.
<p>
There are two syntaxes, for mapping value labels (copying from one set of 
labels to another set) and for swapping value labels (interchanging the 
labels associated with two values). 
<p>
The ^label define^ ... ^, modify^ command that executes the copying is 
echoed to the monitor. 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
Suppose that variable ^gender^ is coded ^0^ for male and ^1^ for female by 
<p>
^label def gender 0 "male" 1 "female"^ 
^label val gender gender^ 
<p>
but we find it convenient to reverse the coding: 
<p>
^replace gender = 1 - gender^ 
<p>
We need to reverse the value labels. Slow but sure is 
<p>
^label def gender 0 "female" 1 "male", modify^ 
<p>
An alternative is 
<p>
^labcopy gender, s(0 1)^ 
<p>
Suppose we have a set of labels 
<p>
^label def rating 1 "poor" 2 "fair" 3 "OK" 4 "good" 5 "excellent"^ 
<p>
and we wish to reverse the labelling. This is done by 
<p>
^labcopy rating, f(1/5) t(5/1)^ 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^from(^numlist^)^ specifies a numlist of integers whose value labels are 
    to be copied. These labels will not be changed unless an element of the 
    numlist also appears in ^to( )^. 
<p>
^to(^numlist^)^ specifies a numlist of integers whose value labels are to 
    be defined. Existing value labels are modified. 
<p>
^from( )^ and ^to( )^ must contain the same number of elements after expansion.
&gt;  
<p>
All replacements take place independently. Thus ^from(2 1) to(1 2)^ would 
swap value labels associated with 1 and 2: the label of 2 becomes that of 
1, and vice versa. (^swap(1 2)^ would in practice be the way to do this.) 
<p>
^swap(^#1 #2^)^ specifies two non-negative integers possessing value labels 
    under valuelabelname whose labels are to be swapped. 
<p>
^list^ invokes ^label list^ valuelabelname after the changes produced. 
    
    
Examples
--------
<p>
    . ^labcopy gender, s(0 1)^
    . ^labcopy rating, f(1/5) t(5/1)^
    . ^labcopy foo, f(1 1 1 1) t(2/5)^
