<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    Featured list of Stata files in the working directory
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>lall</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] [<b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>]
<p>
        <b>ldo</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] [<b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>]
<p>
        <b>ldta</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] [<b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>]
<p>
        <b>lgph</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] [<b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>]
<p>
        <b>lmata</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] [<b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>]
<p>
        <b>lsmcl</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] [<b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>]
<p>
    where <i>stub</i> may be a single letter or any combination of characters that
    can be used for filenames.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    The above programs return lists of Stata files in the working directory.
    Along with the file names, the programs offer a list of click-able links
    for some typical tasks that one wants to do for the files.
<p>
    If <i>stub</i> is specified, only files with names containing<i> stub</i> are listed.
<p>
    All programs save back the list of files in a local macro.
<p>
    <b>ldta</b> provides links for describing, and using each Stata data set in the
    working directory.
<p>
    <b>ldo</b> provides links for viewing, editing, and running each Stata do-file
    in the working directory. You can define the Editor that is invoked when
    clicking on the edit-item of <b>ldo</b> by setting the global macro "MYEDITOR"
    to the command that opens your preferred text editor. I, for example, put
<p>
        ------------------- profile.do
        <b>global MYEDITOR !emacsclient -n</b>
        -------------------------------
<p>
    in my profile file, which works under Linux. Windows users might prefer
    something along the following lines
<p>
        -------------------- profile.do
        <b>global MYEDITOR winexec textpad</b>
        -------------------------------
<p>
    <b>lsmcl</b> provides links for viewing, and translating each Stata SMCL-file in
    the working directory.
<p>
    <b>lgph</b> provides links for displaying, printing, and exporting each Stata
    gph file in the working directory.
<p>
    <b>lmata</b> provides links for viewing, editing, and compiling each Mata-file
    in the working directory. You can define the Editor that is invoked when
    clicking on the edit-item of <b>lmata</b> by setting the global macro "MYEDITOR"
    to the command that opens your preferred text editor. See help for <b>ldo</b>
    above.
<p>
    <b>lall</b> provides links for all .dta, .do, .smcl, and .gph files in the
    working directory along with the click-able links described above.
<p>
    The programs are most valueable if you link them with a function-key in
    your profile (see help profile). If you, for example, add the following
    lines in your profile.do file, you can issue the commands by pressing F4,
    F5, F6 or F7 respectively.
<p>
    --------------- profile.do
    <b>global F4 "ldta, erase ;"</b>
    <b>global F5 "ldo, erase ;"</b>
    <b>global F6 "lgph, erase ;"</b>
    <b>global F7 "lsmcl, erase ;"</b>
    --------------------------
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b> brings up yet another click-able item which allows to erase files
        on disk. Clicking on that item removes the respective file
        immediately from the disk. The file is not moved to the recycle bin.
        The erase button is printed in red to indicate that it should be
        handled with care.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Example</u></b>
<p>
        <b>. ldo</b>
        <b>. ldta</b>
        <b>. lgph, e</b>
        <b>. lsmcl, e</b>
