    <b>levenshtein</b> -- Calculate the Levenshtein edit distance between two
    strings.
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
    Calculate the Levenshtein edit distance between two strings
<p>
        <b>levenshtein</b> <i>string1 string2</i>

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>levenshtein</b> calculate the Levenshtein edit distance(s) between two
    strings or two vectors of strings. The Levenshtein edit distance is
    defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions
    necessary to change one string into the other. For example, the
    Levenshtein edit distance between "mitten" and "fitting" is 3, since the
    following three edits change one into the other, and it is impossible to
    do it with fewer than three edits:
<p>
        1. <b>m</b>itten -&gt; <b>f</b>itten (substitution of 'f' for 'm')
<p>
        2. fitt<b>e</b>n -&gt; fitt<b>i</b>n (substitution of 'i' for 'e')
<p>
        3. fittin -&gt; fittin<b>g</b> (insert 'g' at the end)
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    1. Calculate the Levenshtein edit distance between "mitten" and
    "fitting":
<p>
       <b>. </b>levenshtein mitten fitting
<p>
<p>
    2. Calculate the Levenshtein edit distance between two string vectors:
<p>
       <b>. </b>sysuse auto, clear
<p>
       <b>. </b>decode foreign, gen(foreign_string)
<p>
       <b>. </b>levenshtein make foreign_string, gen(edit_dist)
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Notes</u></b>
<p>
    <b>levenshtein</b> is implemented as a plugin in order to minimize memory
    requirements and to maximize speed.  Unfortunately, plugins are specific
    to the hardware architecture and software framework of your computer,
    i.e., plugins are not cross-platform.  Define a platform by two
    characteristics: machine type and operating system.  Stata stores these
    characteristics in <b>c(machine_type)</b> and <b>c(os)</b>, respectively. <b>levenshtein</b>
    supports the following platforms at this time:
<p>
         <b>Machine type</b>                   <b>Operating system</b>
         PC                             Windows
         PC (64-bit x86-64)             Unix
         Macintosh                      MacOSX
         Macintosh (Intel 64-bit)       MacOSX

    The algorithm used to calculate the Levenshtein edit distance is based on
    a Python extension written by David Necas (Yeti).  His code is publicly
    available at
    http://code.google.com/p/pylevenshtein/source/browse/trunk/Levenshtein.c.
