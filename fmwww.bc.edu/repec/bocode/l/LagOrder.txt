Title: LagOrder: GAUSS module to determine the optimal lag order in the VAR model based on Information Criteria

Authors: Scott Hacker and Abdulnasser Hatemi-J

Abstract: 
This GAUSS module calculates four multivariate information criteria (namely- AIC, SBC, HQC and HJC) to determine the optimal lag order in a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. 
It also provides the matrix of coefficients based on suggested lag length by each information criterion.

Applications are allowed only if proper reference is provided. For non-Commercial applications only.

No performance guarantee is made. Bug reports are welcome.
