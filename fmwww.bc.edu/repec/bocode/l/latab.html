Produce LaTeX output from tabulate
----------------------------------
<p>
    ^latab^ varlist [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    [, ^tf(^filename^)^ ^replace^ ^app^end ^row^ ^col^ 
    ^ncom^ ^dec(^#^)^ ^tx(^#^)^]
<p>
^fweights^, ^aweights^, and ^iweights^ are allowed by ^latab^.
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^latab^ tabulates the varlist (max of 2 variables) and
produces a display with LaTeX code embedded in the output.
The user may then copy from this display (or copy from a
log file) and paste into a LaTeX document. In addition, the 
user may also send the output to a file which can be read into
a LaTeX document when it is compiled. 
<p>
^latab^ is a companion program to ^latabstat^ which produces LaTeX 
output from ^tabstat^.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^tf^(filename) indicates the text file to which the output should
be sent. Path names can be included, but do not include the ".tex"
file extension. The usual Stata options (replace or append) must be
used or an error message will result if the file already exists.
The ^append^ option adds the code to an already existing file while
the ^replace^ option overwrites any already existing file which has
the same name.
<p>
Frequencies (default), row (^row^) and column (^col^) percentages
are all possible, though only one of these is allowed in any
single table. 
<p>
The default display shows frequencies, with commas and no
decimal places. Options for formatting include no comma
- ^ncom^ - and a specified number of decimal places
- ^dec(^#^)^. These options may be combined (eg. ncom dec(2)).
<p>
The default output produces code for the LaTeX command ^tabular^.
However, this can be changed with the ^tx^ option to produce
commands suitable for the extension package ^tabularx^.
When the ^tx(^#^)^ option is used the width of the table is set to
the number (in centimetres) specified. If you wish the table
to be set to the ^{\linewidth}^ command, enter the number 0.
The user must remember to include a ^\usepackage^
^{tabularx}^ command in the preamble of the document.
<p>
<p>
Warnings
--------
<p>
Any variables used by ^latab^ must have value labels
attached. Failure to do so results in an error message.
<p>
The filename is read and included in the output. If the file
is located in a different directory to the current directory,
the pathname will also appear in the code. This may mean further
editing of the the LaTeX code is required in your text editor to
remove offending path separators (\) which also signal 
LaTeX commands. Similarly, if you use underscore characters
in your filenames, these will also need to be removed. 
<p>
For example: 
<p>
\footnotesize{\emph{Source:} d:\mymain\mydirectory\my_data.dta}
<p>
would need to be edited to become:
<p>
\footnotesize{\emph{Source:} mydata.dta}
<p>
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
. ^latab sex race, ncom dec(2) row^
. ^latab birthplace sex, dec(1) col^
. ^latab birthplace race if sex==1^ 
  ^latab birthplace race, tf(birthrace) replace^

<p>
This table can be cross-referenced in the body of your text
with the name: birthplace_by_collar_f
<p>
<p>
Note on LaTeX
-------------
<p>
The syntax code produced by ^latab^ contains a caption label
(based on the variable names) which can be used in the body
of your text to cross reference the table.
<p>
The source of the table is given as the State data file
name, though a search and replace in your text editor can
easily change this to a more meaningful name.
<p>
The display produced by ^latab^ is in two colours (green and
yellow) for ease of copying. If you require all the code to 
produce a table from scratch, copy the lot. If you only require 
the data itself (you may have already set up your table code 
in your LaTeX document), copy just the yellow output.
<p>
If you are using the file output option, ^tf^, you can include the
table in your LaTeX document using the \input{filename} command. 
The \include{filename} command always places the table on a new
page.
<p>
Finally, the code produced by ^latab^ may not be
optimal LaTeX code for tables. Further tweaking of the code
inside your text editor may be necessary. Any suggestions for 
improving the LaTeX code would be most welcome.
