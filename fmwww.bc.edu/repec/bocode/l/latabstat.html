Produce LaTeX output from tabstat

<p>
^fweights^ and ^aweights^ are allowed by ^latabstat^.
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^latabstat^ is a modification of ^tabstat^ which produces a display 
with LaTeX code embedded in the output. The user may then copy from 
this display (or copy from a log file) and paste into a LaTeX document. 
In addition, the user may also send the output to a file which can be
read into a LaTeX document when it is compiled.
<p>
^latabstat^ is a companion program to ^latab^ which produces LaTeX 
output from ^tabulate^.
<p>
^latabstat^ is used in exactly the same way as ^tabstat^, but with 
some additional options. See -help ^tabstat^- for information on the 
usage of ^tabstat^ and its normal options.
<p>
Options unique to ^latabstat^ (see also options under ^tabstat^)
---------------------------
<p>
^tf^(filename) indicates the text file to which the output should
be sent. Path names can be included, but do not include the ".tex"
file extension. The usual Stata options (replace or append) must be
used or an error message will result if the file already exists. 
The ^append^ option adds the code to an already existing file while
the ^replace^ option overwrites any already existing file which has
the same name.
<p>
The default output produces code for the LaTeX command ^tabular^.
However, this can be changed with the ^tx^ option to produce
commands suitable for the extension package ^tabularx^.
When the ^tx(^#^)^ option is used the width of the table is set to
the number (in centimetres) specified. If you wish the table
to be set to the ^{\linewidth}^ command, enter the number 0.
The user must remember to include a ^\usepackage^
^{tabularx}^ command in the preamble of the document.
<p>
^cap^tion(string) allows you to provide a title for the table. 
The usual ^tabstat^ title is often complex, and unsuited for 
publication quality tables, so it has been suppressed from the 
output. Instead, you employ this option to provide your own title 
(\caption command in LaTeX). This option may be omitted and 
the caption later typed into your LaTeX document.
<p>
^cl^abel(string) allows you to enter the \caption{\label{  } 
information which is used by LaTeX for cross-referencing tables.
This option may be omitted and later typed into your LaTeX document.
<p>
^hw^idth(#) allows you to specify the width of the
column headings. If omitted, the default values from
^tabstat^ are used.
<p>
Note that the stubwidth can be adjusted (as it is with ^tabstat^ 
normally) using the ^la^belwidth(#) option. ^latabstat^ has 
increased the maximum value of this width from 32 to 60. This can
be changed by modifying the code in latabstat.ado.
<p>
<p>
Warnings
--------
<p>
The filename is read and included in the output. If the file
is located in a different directory to the current directory,
the pathname will also appear in the code. This may mean further
editing of the the LaTeX code is required in your text editor to
remove offending path separators (\) which also signal 
LaTeX commands. Similarly, if you use underscore characters
in your filenames, these will also need to be removed. 
<p>
For example: 
<p>
\footnotesize{\emph{Source:} d:\mymain\mydirectory\my_data.dta}
<p>
would need to be edited to become:
<p>
\footnotesize{\emph{Source:} mydata.dta}
<p>
<p>
<p>
Examples with output

\hline
\multicolumn{3}{@{}l}{\footnotesize{\emph{Source:} auto.dta}}
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
<p>
The table has been written to the file:d:\texdocs\avprice.tex
<p>
<p>
Note on LaTeX
-------------
<p>
The source of the table is given as the State data file
name, though a search and replace in your text editor can
easily change this to a more meaningful name.
<p>
The display produced by ^latabstat^ is in two colours (green and
yellow) for ease of copying. If you require all the code to 
produce a table from scratch, copy the lot. If you only require 
the data itself (you may have already set up your table code 
in your LaTeX document), copy just the yellow output.
<p>
If you are using the file output option, ^tf^, you can include the
table in your LaTeX document using the \input{filename} command. 
The \include{filename} command always places the table on a new
page.
<p>
Finally, the code produced by ^latabstat^ may not be
optimal LaTeX code for tables. Further tweaking of the code
inside your text editor may be necessary. Any suggestions for 
improving the LaTeX code would be most welcome.
