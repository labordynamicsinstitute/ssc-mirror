<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>ldir</b> Clickable list of folder names
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
        <b>ldir</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] [ <b>,</b> <b><u>h</u></b><b>idden</b> ]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>ldir</b> lists the names of folders or directories in compact form and allow
    to click on the names to make it the working directory.
<p>
    If <i>stub</i> is specified, only folders with names containing<i> stub</i> are listed.
<p>
    If Nick Winter's user written program <i>fastcd</i> has been used to define
    bookmarks, those bookmarks are also shown. In addition ldir shows the
    clickable link [+] for adding the current working directory to the list
    of bookmarks. If the current working directory is already bookmarked the
    clickable link [-] can be used to remove it from the list of bookmarks.
<p>
    The list of foldernames is returned in r(folders), so long as that is not
    empty.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>hidden</b> By default, <b>ldir</b> does not list folder names starting with ".";
        these are the so called "hidden" folders on Linux/UNIX systems. The
        option <b>hidden</b> lists these folders as well.
<p>
<b><u>Example(s)</u></b>
