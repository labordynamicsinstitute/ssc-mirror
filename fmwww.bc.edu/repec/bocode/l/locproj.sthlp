{title:Description}

{p}{cmd:locproj} estimates linear and non-linear Impulse Response Functions (IRF) based on the local projections methodology first proposed by Jord√† (2005). 
The procedure allows easily implementation of several options used in the growing literature of local projections. {p_end}

{p}{cmd:locproj} reports the IRF, together with its standard error and confidence interval, as an output matrix and through an IRF graph. 
The user can easily choose different options for the desired IRF graph, as well as other options to save and use the results.{p_end}

{p}{cmd:locproj} allows the user to choose different estimation methods for both time series and panel data, including some instrumental variables methods 
currently available in Stata such as {cmd:ivregress} or {cmd:xtivreg}.{p_end}

{p}{cmd:locproj} uses the Stata command {cmd:lincom} to estimate the response to the shock variable or variables, allowing to estimate responses to linear
combinations of variables, including interactions with factor or continuous variables. Importantly, it also allows the use of marginal effects instead of 
regression coefficients, which is highly convenient when the response variable is binary and the user wants to estimate the response as a probability.
In the latter case, {cmd:locproj} makes use of the Stata command {cmd:margins}, which could further facilitate the estimation of responses when 
the shock corresponds to an interaction of variables (factor or continuous) instead of just a single variable.{p_end}

{p}{cmd:locproj} also allows different options regarding the horizon and the response starting period. For instance, it allows having initial steps 
different from zero, including negative starting horizons, automatically adjusting the output and the way in which the lags of the 
dependent variable are included. {p_end}

{p}{cmd:locproj} generates temporary variables with the necessary transformations of the response variable in order to estimate the IRF 
in the desired transformation option, such as levels, logs, differences, log-differences, cumulative changes or cumulative log-differences. 
For every option, the procedure also generates temporary variables with the corresponding transformation of the dependent variable 
needed in case the user wants to include lags of the dependent variable that are consistent with the chosen transformation.{p_end}

{p}The options allow defining the desired specification in a fully automatic or in a more explicit way, with many alternatives in between. {p_end}

{p}If the user chooses the automatic specification, the syntax is very close to a typical regression command in Stata, 
with the only restriction that {cmd:locproj} interprets the variable that corresponds to the shock (impulse) as the one just after 
the dependent variable or its lagged terms, and only that one variable represents the shock. {p_end}

{p}Alternatively, the user can choose to explicitly define the shock variable (or variables), the number of lags of the shock, the number of lags 
of the dependent variable, and the control variables. As mentioned before, the user can play with alternatives between the 
fully automatic or the fully explicit, depending on which option is easier or more convenient to use.{p_end}

{p}The explicit option is recommended when the shock should include more than one variable, for instance, an additional non-linear term, 
or an interaction with another variable.
{p_end} 

{p 4 8 2}{bf:Remark:} If the shock includes an interaction with a categorical variable, then we must use one of the options
{opt lcs()} or {opt margins()}.{p_end}

{marker specification}{...}
{syntab:{bf:Model Specification:}}

{synopt:{opt h:or(numlist/integer)}}Specifies the number of steps or horizon length for the IRF. The initial horizon could be negative.
It can be specified either as a range (e.g. {it:hor(0/6)} or {it:hor(-3/6)}), or just as the final horizon period (e.g. {it:hor(6)}) 
in which case the command assumes the horizon starts at period 0 and ends in period 6. The default horizon range is {it:hor = 0,...,5} 
if nothing is specified.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt s:hock(varlist)}}Allows to explicitly define the variable or variables that represent the shock or impulse that 
will generate the response and the IRF. If this option is not specified the command will automatically choose the first variable that 
is inmmediately after the {depvar} and its lagged terms if they are included in the main {it:varlist}.
This option should be used when the desired shock includes more than one variable, for instance a non-linear term or 
an interaction term.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt lcs(string)}}Specifies an expression, usually an addition of variables, that defines a linear combination of variables that represents 
the desired impulse (shock).  This option should be used when the desired shock includes more than one variable and the name of one of them 
is not explictily included in the syntax variable list, for instance the constant term ({it:_cons}), or the expansion of an expression that
includes factor variable terms, e.g. {it:12.code#c.xvar}. The expression that should go inside the parenthesis is analogous to any expression 
that is tested using the commands {cmd:lincom} or {cmd:test}.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt sl:ags(integer)}}Specifies explicitly the number of lags of the shock variable or variables that should be included in the specification.
The lagged terms of the shock could also be included directly in the main {it:varlist} next to the first variable that represents the shock.
If more than one variable is specified through the option {opt s:hock()} then the specification will include lags of all of them.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt yl:ags(integer)}}Specifies explicitly the number of lags of the {depvar} that should be included in the specification. 
The way the lags of the dependent variable are included changes depending on the type of tranformation that is defined by the user 
through the option {opt tr:ansf()}.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt c:ontrols(varlist)}}Allows to explicitly define the variable or variables that represent the control variables. 
If this option is not specified the command simply includes all the variables that are inmmediately after the shock variable(s) 
and its lagged terms if they are included in the main {it:varlist}. 
The control variables could include any number of lags, interactions, or any other desired transformations.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt fc:ontrols(varlist)}}Specifies any control variable(s) that should be included at the same horizon as the IRF, 
i.e. that their forecast should be included depending on the horizon, i.e. {it:fcontrol(t+h)} with {it:h = 0...hor}.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt tr:ansf(string)}}Specifies the type of transformation that should be applied to the dependent variable when generating the forecasts that are used for each 
horizon of the local projection. The available transformations available are the ones in the following list, and they should be written exactly as they are shown:{p_end}

{p 39 42 2}1. {bf:(level)}: {it:Levels: }It keeps the dependent variable as originally specified and uses its forecast {it:h} periods ahead 
for each horizon of the IRF, i.e. {it:y(t+h)} with {it:h = 0...hor}. It is the default option in case no transformation is specified. 
When the option {opt yl:ags()} is specified, it includes lags of the variable in levels, i.e. {it:y(t-l)} with {it:l = 1,...,ylags}.{p_end}

{p 39 42 2}2. {bf:(diff)}: {it:Differences: }It uses forecasts of the dependent variable in simple "differences", i.e. {it:y(t+h) - y(t+h-1)} 
with {it:h = 0...hor}. When the option {opt yl:ags()} is specified, it includes lags of the variable in differences, i.e. {it:y(t)-y(t-l)} 
with {it:l = 1,...,ylags}.{p_end}

{p 39 42 2}3. {bf:(cmlt)}: {it:Cumulative differences: }It uses forecasts of the dependent varible in cumulative differences, 
i.e. {it:y(t+h) - y(t-1)} with {it:h = 0...hor}. When the option {opt yl:ags()} is specified, it includes lags of the variable 
in differences, i.e. {it:y(t)-y(t-l)} with {it:l = 1,...,ylags}.{p_end}

{p 39 42 2}4. {bf:(logs)}: {it:Logs: }It uses forecasts of the logarithm of the dependent varible, i.e. {it:ln(y(t+h))} with {it:h = 0...hor}. 
When the option {opt yl:ags()} is specified, it includes lags of the logarithm of the variable, i.e. {it:ln(y(t-l))} with {it:l = 1,...,ylags}.{p_end}

{p 39 42 2}5. {bf:(logs diff)}: {it:Log-differences: }It uses forecasts of the dependent variable in differences of its natural logarithm, 
i.e. {it:ln(y(t+h)) - ln(y(t+h-1))} with {it:h = 0...hor}. When the option {opt yl:ags()} is specified, it includes lags of the variable in log-differences, 
i.e. {it:ln(y(t))-ln(y(t-l))} with {it:l = 1,...,ylags}.{p_end}

{p 39 42 2}6. {bf:(logs cmlt)}: {it:Cumulative log-differences: }It uses forecasts of the dependent variable in cumulative differences of its natural logarithm, 
i.e. {it:ln(y(t+h)) - ln(y(t-1))} with {it:h = 0...hor}. When the option {opt yl:ags()} is specified, it includes lags of the variable in log-differences, 
i.e. {it:ln(y(t))-ln(y(t-l))} with {it:l = 1,...,ylags}.{p_end}

{syntab:{bf:Marginal Effects Options:}}

{synopt:{opt marg:ins}}Specifies that the marginal effect of the shock variable is used instead of the regression coefficients. 
For simplicity, it only allows using the dydx option of the command {cmd:margins}. See {help margins} for specific help about 
the command {cmd:margins}{p_end}

{synopt:{opt mrfv:ar(varlist)}}Specifies the factor or continuous variable that it is interacted with the shock variable in the specification.
This option should be used together with the {opt s:hock(varlist)} option and the {opt marg:ins} option.{p_end} 

{synopt:{opt mrpr:ed(string)}}Specifies the option to be used with the predict command to produce the variable that will be used as the response 
when using the {opt marg:ins} option, e.g. {it:pr}, {it:pc1}, {it:pu0}, {it:xb}. It this option is not specified it uses the default option of the estimation method being used.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt mro:pt(string)}}Allows to specify other options available in the command {cmd: margins} that have not been specified in the previous marginal effect options. 
 See {help margins} for specific help about using the command {cmd:margins}.{p_end}


{marker estimation}{...}
{syntab:{bf:Estimation Method:}}

{synopt:{opt m:et(string)}}Specifies the estimation method. The default is {cmd:xtreg} when using panel data and {cmd:reg} 
when using time-series data. Any estimation method with a standard syntax is allowed. Additionally, the command allows 
to use the instrumental variable commands {cmd:ivregress} and {cmd:xtivreg} and other IV methods with a similar syntax.
In the specific case of {cmd:ivregress}, the user also has to specify the "estimator" within the {opt met()} option 
in the following way: 
{bf:met(ivregress {it:estimator})}, where {it:estimator} could be either on of {it: 2sls, liml or gmm}. 
When any IV method is specified, a list of instruments must also be provided through the option {opt instr(varlist)}.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt ins:tr(varlist)}}Specifies the variables to use as instruments for the impulse (shock) variable when using an 
instrumental variable method such as {cmd:ivregress} or {cmd:xtivreg}. The shock variable must be defined as 
in any of the model specification available options.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt hopt(string)}}Specifies any methodological option that depends directly on the horizon of the IRF, i.e. any option 
that must change with every step/horizon of the IRF {it:h = 0...hor}.{p_end}

{synopt:{it:model_options}}Specifies any other estimation options specific to the method used and not defined elsewhere. 
If the user wants to specify any methodological option corresponding to the estimation method being used, she only has to 
enter them alongside the rest of {cmd:locproj} options.{p_end}


{marker display}{...}
{syntab:{bf:Displaying Results:}}

{synopt:{opt noi:sily}}If this option is specified, the command displays a regression output for each one of the horizons. If this option 
is not specified the command only returns a matrix with the IRF, its standard error and the confidence bands. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt st:ats}}If this option is specified, the command displays a table with the summary statistics of the estimated regression
at each step/horizon. The table includes the number of observations, the R-squared or pseudo-R-squared, the F-statistic or Chi2-statistic,
and the p-value (prob) of the respective statistic. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt conf(numlist)}}Specifies one or (max) two confidence levels for calculating the confidence bands. The default is 95%. {p_end}

{synopt:{opt save:irf}}If this option is specified, the IRF, its standard error and the confidence bands are saved as new variables, otherwise 
no new variables are created. If this option is specified, the command assigns a default name to the new generated variables.{p_end}

{synopt:{opt irfn:ame(string)}}Specifies a name/prefix for the new IRF variable and the other new generated variables (standard error 
and confidence bands).{p_end}

{synopt:{opt f:act(real)}}Specifies a factor for scaling the IRF, for instance, if the user wants to express the log difference transformation 
in percentage terms, this option should be specified as fact(100).{p_end}


{marker graph_options}{...}
{syntab:{bf:Graph Options:}}

{synopt:{opt nograph}}If this option is specified a graph is not displayed.{p_end}

{marker ivtests}{...}
{syntab:{bf:Instrumental Variables Tests:}}

{synopt:{opt ivt:est(string)}}If this option is specified, the command performs and displays one out of the three postestimation tests 
that are available after using the command {cmd:ivregress}, for each step/horizon. The three available tests are the endogeneity 
test (endogenous), first-stage regression statistics (firststage), and the test of overindentifying restrictions (overid).
The user has to write inside the parenthesis the exact name of the test, either {it: endogenous}, {it: firststage} or {it: overid}, and if necessary/desired, 
a comma and the corresponding/available test options. See {help ivregress} and {help ivregress postestimation} for specific help about using the post-estimation

{title:Example 1.1 Specification of shock and control variables}

{p 4 4 0}What the automatic vs. explicit specification means is that the user can let {cmd:locproj} interpret in an automatic way
which variables provided on the {it:varlist} correspond to the dependent variable, which one is the shock, 
which ones are control variables, and also which ones are just lags of each type of variable. Alternatively,
in more complicated cases, the user can specify all those details in a explicit way using the available options for 
such cases.{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}The simplest local projection specification in which the response variable is {bf:y} and the shock variable is {bf:n} would be 
(automatic specification):{p_end}

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y n}{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}Which would also be equivalent to the following (explicit specification):

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y, shock(n)}{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}We can also add control variables by adding them after the shock one or using the option controls. In this case our control
variable is {bf:r}

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y n r}{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}Which would be equivalent to the following (explicit specification):

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y, shock(n) controls(r)}{p_end}

{title:Example 1.2 Specification of lags of dependent variable, shock and control variables}

{p 4 4 0}We might want to include lags of the dependent variable, the shock or the control variables.
For the dependent variable and the shock, there are explicit options, whether for the control variables you just need
to add them either on the {it:varlist} or as additional variables in the {bf:controls()} option.
 
{p 4 4 0}In all of the following examples we define that the dependent variable has one lag, that the shock
variable has 2 lags and that the control variable has 3 lags. They all are exactly equivalent:{p_end}

{title:Example 1.11. Interaction of a dummy variable with the shock}

{p 4 4 0}We want to specify a different reaction to our shock variable before and after the global financial crisis (GFC).  
We first need to generate two dummy variables. The first dummy variable {bf:bef_gfc} is equal to one before the first quarter of 2009
and zero afterwards, meanwhile the second dummy variable {bf:aft_gfc} is equal to one after the first quarter of 2009 and zero before that.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen aft_gfc = dateq>=tq(2009q1)}{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}We can also generate two interaction variables, i.e. the product of the dummy variables times the shock variable {bf:n}. 
The first interaction variable is equal to {bf:n} before the GFC and equal to zero afterwards. The second interaction variable is 
equal to zero before the GFC and equal to {bf:n} afterwards.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen n_bef = n*bef_gfc}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen n_aft = n*aft_gfc}{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}Using the interaction variable {bf:n_aft}, we can estimate the IRF resulting from the shock variable {bf:n} after the GFC
in any of the following two equivalent ways:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y, s(n n_aft) ylags(1) slags(2) controls(l(0/3).r hor(12))}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y l.y l(0/3).r, s(n n_aft) sl(2) hor(12)}{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}In a similar way that in the quadratic term case from the previous example, the resulting IRF after the GFC corresponds to 
the addition of the individual coefficients of the variables {bf:n} and {bf:n_aft}, thus we have to specify that the shock corresponds 
to both variables, which is done by including both of them inside the option {opt shock()}.{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}The interpretation of each individual coeefficient is the following: the coefficient of the variable {bf:n} corresponds to the 
impact before the GFC, and the coefficient of the variable {bf:n_aft} corresponds to the difference between the two periods.{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}Correspondingly, we can use the interaction variable {bf:n_bef} to estimate the IRF resulting from the shock variable {bf:n} before 
the GFC in any of the following two equivalent ways:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y, s(n_bef n) ylags(1) slags(2) controls(l(0/3).r hor(12))}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj y l.y l(0/3).r, s(n_bef n) sl(2) hor(12)}{p_end}

{p 4 4 0}In this case, the IRF before the GFC corresponds to the addition of the individual coefficients of the variables {bf:n} and {bf:n_bef}, 
meanwhile the coefficient of the variable {bf:n} corresponds to the impact after the GFC, and the coefficient of the variable {bf:n_bef}
corresponds to the difference between the two periods.{p_end}

{title:Example 2. Non-linear effects and interactions: Using the option {opt lcs()}}

{p}In this example we will replicate Example 1.11 but using the option {opt lcs()}. We are going to use the dummy variable {bf:aft_gfc} that
is equal to one after the first quarter of 2009. But now we are going to use the factor variables syntax to specify the shock, and thus,
we will need to use the option {opt lcs()}, since the syntax of factor variables could be more complicated, although sometimes more 
convenient to use.{p_end}

{p}The option {opt lcs()} allows us to specify the shock in any way we want, as long as is expressed as a linear combination of the variables 
included in the model specification.{p_end}

{p}We will first reproduce exactly what we did in Example 1.11 but using the factor variables syntax. In this case, the model specification 
includes both the variable {bf:n} and the interaction of the GFC dummy {bf:aft_gfc} and the variable {bf:n}. The interpretation of the 
coefficients of each variable are the same as in Example 1.11, the coefficient of the variable {bf:n} corresponds to the response during 
the period preceding the GFC, meanhwile the coefficient of the variable {bf:1.aft_gfc#c.n} corresponds to the difference in the response 
between the two periods. Thus the total response after the GFC is equal to the sum of the two coefficients. (In this specification the variable
{bf:0.aft_gfc#c.n} is omitted).{p_end}

{p}However, if we only include the interaction between the dummy and the continuous variable {bf:aft_gfc#c.n} then the response after the GFC is

the variable {bf:0.aft_gfc#c.n}{p_end}

We also need to drop WWI and WWII years from JST dataset:

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. drop if year >=1914 & year <=1919}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. drop if year >=1939 & year <=1947}{p_end}

{p}In the "RecessionDummies" database, the variable {bf:F} is a Financial Crisis dummy variable, while the variable {bf:N} is a Normal Recession dummy variable. 
In this example we want to look at the cumulative IRF of real GDP per capita to a financial crisis, while controling for the effect of normal recessions, 
and viceversa. Thus, we need to use the option {opt lcs()} since the effect we are looking for is the sum of the constant term plus the effect of 
{bf:F=1} or {bf:N=1}.{p_end}

{p}Therefore, in the following examples we include the expression "_cons + l.F" and "_cons + l.N" inside the option {opt lcs()}. Notice that when we use
the option {opt lcs()} the order of the variables l.F and l.N in the main syntax does not matter, since the shock that {cmd:locproj} evaluates 
is {bf:only determined} by what it is defined by the option {opt lcs()}:{p_end}

{p}We can include more complicated interactions, for instance we can interact the effect of Financial Crisis (F) or Normal Recessions (N) with the
public debt-to-GDP ratio and evaluate the IRF at different levels of such ratio.{p_end}

{p}We first estimate the mean and standard deviation of the Public Debt-to-GDP ratio:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. sum debtgdp}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. sca dm=r(mean)}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. sca dsd=r(sd)}{p_end}

{p}In the command syntax we include the interaction of the public debt ratio with the financial crises and the normal recessions. Then in the {opt lcs()}
we enter the expansion of the interaction between financial crises and the debt ratio {bf:(1.l.F#c.l.debtgdp)}, multiplied by the mean and std. deviaton of
the ratio {bf:(dm+dsd)}:{p_end}

We need to declare the time series variable

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. tsset date}{p_end}

{p}For estimating the IRF using OLS we need to take into consideration that in the example, the response horizon starts at {it:hor = 1}. However, for exactly replicating the example, we need to use the one-step ahead forecast of UNRATE as the dependent variable instead of UNRATE. We also use Newey-West as the variance-covariance estimation method, which requires defining the option {opt lag()} in Newey-West, and thus, we need to use the option
{opt hopt()} in our {cmd:locproj} command:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj f.UNRATE DFF l(1/4).DFF l(1/4).UNRATE, h(0/15) hopt(lag) m(newey) z}{p_end}

{p}For replicating the instrumental variable IRF example, we use the option {opt met()} specifying that the method is {it:ivregress gmm}. 
Notice that in this case the {opt met()} option should include the {it:gmm} sub-method. Additionally, we need to define the instrument(s) 
for the shock, which in this case corresponds to the variable {it:resid_full}. Moreover, we define as an estimation method option the 
variance-covariance estimator {it: hac nwest} in the following way:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj f.UNRATE l(0/4).DFF l(1/4).UNRATE, h(0/15) met(ivregress gmm) instr(resid_full) vce(hac nwest) z}{p_end}

{p}If we had more available instruments we should include them in the {opt instr()}. For instance we can include also the instrument variable
{it:resid_romer}:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj f.UNRATE l(0/4).DFF l(1/4).UNRATE, h(0/15) met(ivregress gmm) instr(resid_full resid_romer) vce(hac nwest) z}{p_end}

{p}If we have more than one instrument and if our estimation method is {cmd:ivregress} we can test whether we have overidentification at every step of 
the local projection. This can be done by using the option {opt ivtest()} which performs and displays one out of the three postestimation tests 
that are available after using the command {cmd:ivregress}, for each step/horizon. For testing overindentifying restrictions we need to use the suboption
{it:overid} inside the option {opt ivtest()}:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj f.UNRATE l(0/4).DFF l(1/4).UNRATE, h(0/15) met(ivregress gmm) instr(resid_full resid_romer) vce(hac nwest) z ivtest(overid)}{p_end}

{title:Example 5. A panel data example and the Cholesky decomposition}

{p}{cmd:locproj} does not need any special adjustments in order to estimate local projections using panel data. We only need to declare the dataset using 
the usual command {cmd:xtset}. {cmd:locproj} recognizes if the dataset is a panel and it uses the command {cmd:xtreg} by default.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. webuse "http://data.macrohistory.net/JST/JSTdatasetR5.dta"}{p_end}

We need to declare the panel data variables:

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. xtset ifs year}{p_end}

We first need to generate some variables:

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen lgdpr = 100*ln(rgdppc*pop)}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen lcpi = 100*ln(cpi)}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen dlgdpr = d.lgdpr}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen dstir = d.stir}{p_end}

{p}Throughout this example we assume that the real GDP (GDPR) responds with a lag to shocks in the short-term interest rate (STIR) and to shocks 
in consumer prices (CPI); CPI responds with a lag to shocks in STIR and contemporaneously to shocks in GDPR; STIR responds contemporaneously 
to shocks in GDPR and CPI.{p_end}

{p}Now, we can estimate the response of real GDP to a 1pp shock to the real short-term interest rate. The next five examples are exactly equivalent. 
They differ in how to define the shock variable and its lags, and the dependent variable and its lags. In all of them, the estimation method is {cmd:xtreg}, 
they use the "fixed-effect" estimator and a cluster-robust covariance matrix. They use a confidence level of 90%. The graph options define the values of 
the y-axis, they y-axis title, the x-axis label and the title of the graph:{p_end}

{p}In all the previous equivalent five examples, the shock variable is included with a lag and no contemporaneous term (L.D.stir), and thus, the response at {it:hor = 0} is equal to 0 and an extra period is added to 
the final horizon period.{p_end}


{p}Alternatively, in the next example, when estimating the response of CPI to the short-term interest rate, we just need to change the dependent variable to CPI instead of GDPR in any of the previous examples. 
We also need to change the number of lags of the control variable, which in this case is the GDP, from (0/3) to (1/3) in order to specify a Cholesky decomposition.{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj lcpi, s(l.d.stir) c(l(0/3).d.lgdpr) tr(diff) h(4) yl(3) sl(2) fe cluster(iso) z conf(90) gropt(ytitle(Percent)) tti(Year) title(Response of CPI to 1pp shock to STIR (Cholesky))}{p_end}


{p}Finally, in the final exercise, the shock variable is the same as the dependent variable, so it is more convenient to use an explicit option 
for the shock and its lags.Moreover, the first response at {it:hor = 0} is equal to 1 since the response variable and the shock are the same
at that horizon period.{p_end}

{title:Example 6. Non-linear effects, interactions and binary dependent variable: Using the option {opt margins}}

{p}We need again the JST and the "RecessionDummies" datasets:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. use "http://data.macrohistory.net/JST/JSTdatasetR5.dta"}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. merge 1:1 year iso using "RecessionDummies.dta", nogen}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. xtset ifs year}{p_end}

We also need to drop WWI and WWII years from JST dataset:

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. drop if year >=1914 & year <=1919}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. drop if year >=1939 & year <=1947}{p_end}

{p}In our first example, we will estimate the IRF of the probability of a banking crisis to an increase in the USA short-term interest rate. 
Our dependent variable in this case is the dummy variable {bf:crisisJST} that is equal to 1 for banking crises.{p_end}

{p}We need to generate a new variable {bf:stir_us} with the US interest rate as a common variable for all the countries in the sample, in order
to estimate the response of the probability of a banking crisis to the short-term interest rate in the US:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. gen stir_us0=stir if iso=="USA"}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. egen stir_us=mean(stir_us0), by(year)}{p_end}

{p}Now we are going to estimate the IRF using the option {opt margins}. The option {opt margins} estimates the marginal effect of a unit of
our shock variable (stir_us) on the probability of a banking crisis, which is our dependent (response) variable. 
We are using as estimation method the command {cmd:xtlogit} with fixed effects:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj crisisJST l(0/2).stir_us, margins m(xtlogit) fe}{p_end}

{p}We can also interact the shock variable with a dummy variable, for instance, whether a country has a "PEG" foreign exchange regime.{p_end}

{p}The option margins allow us to estimate a separate IRF for each category of the dummy variable PEG. For doing that we need to use the option
{opt mrfvar()}. In this option we need to specify the expansion of the {bf:categorical variable that has been interacted with our shock variable}.
We also need to use the explicit option to define which variable is our shock without any interaction term, since the command {cmd:margins} 
does not accept an interaction term expression in its {bf:dydx()} option: {p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj crisisJST peg#c.l(0/2).stir_us, s(stir_us) margins m(xtlogit) fe mrfvar(1.peg)}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj crisisJST peg#c.l(0/2).stir_us, s(stir_us) margins m(xtlogit) fe mrfvar(0.peg)}{p_end}

{p}Alternatively, instead of entering the shock variable as {bf:peg#c.l(0/2).stir_us} in the main syntax, we can enter the expression 
{bf:l(0/2).stir_us peg#c.l(0/2).stir_us} and in this way the command would use the variable {bf:stir_us} as the shock variable, 
whithout the need to specify it through the {cmd:locproj} option {opt shock()}:{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj crisisJST l(0/2).stir_us peg#c.l(0/2).stir_us, margins m(xtlogit) fe mrfvar(1.peg)}{p_end}
{p 4 8 2}{cmd:. locproj crisisJST l(0/2).stir_us peg#c.l(0/2).stir_us, margins m(xtlogit) fe mrfvar(0.peg)}{p_end}
