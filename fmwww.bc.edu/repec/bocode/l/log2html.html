<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>log2html</b> translates Stata log files or other files in SMCL to HTML.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>log2html</b> is primarily for use after <b>log</b>; see log.
<p>
    <b>log2html</b> makes use of an undocumented command in Stata version 7 up, <b>log</b>
    <b>html</b>, which generates HTML files from SMCL (e.g. log) files.  SMCL, the
    Stata Markup and Control Language smcl, is the default log file format
    introduced with version 7, and contains markup (similar to HTML) around
    elements of the log file. To use <b>log2html</b> on log files, you must first
    generate the default SMCL log file, not a text log file, with the file
    extension <b>.smcl</b>.  Thus if you have <b>set logtype text</b> to prevent the
    generation of SMCL log files, you must either turn it off or explicitly
    state that a SMCL log file is to be produced, as by<b> log using my.smcl</b>.
<p>
    <b>log2html</b> requires only the base name of a logfile:  e.g. <b>my</b>, if the
    logfile is named <b>my.smcl</b>. The name of the HTML file produced will be this
    base name with <b>.html</b> appended, e.g. <b>my.html</b>.
<p>
    <b>log2html</b> requires Stata version 8 at least.
<p>
    <b>loghtml</b> produces a complete HTML page (i.e. with &lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; tags).
    By default, the page will have a white background; input lines (those
    resulting from user input) are rendered in RGB color "CC6600" (a shade of
    brown); and highlighted result-window lines are rendered in RGB color
    "000099" (a shade of blue).  The options permit other choices for these
    three colors. For best results, one of the 216 "web safe" colors that
    display properly in web browsers on all computers in 256-color mode
    should be used.  Also note that some combinations of colors are not
    workable; e.g. a black ("000000") background will cause all
    normally-rendered text to disappear.
<p>
    Colors are specified as hexadecimal RGB colors ranging from 000000
    (black) to FFFFFF (white), where FF0000 is red, 00FF00 is green, and
    0000FF is blue. It is best to use web-safe colors, where both digits of
    each color pair match and are divisible by 3 (i.e. 00 33 66 99 CC or FF).
<p>
    Those wanting to include the CSS classes used by <b>log2html</b> should make an
    HTML file with the CSS option, and then look at the resulting page in a
    text editor. It will give more insight than any explanation here could
    give.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>replace</b> specifies that if the HTML file exists, it is to be replaced.
<p>
    <b>erase</b> specifies that the SMCL log file is to be erased (deleted) after
        processing.
<p>
    <b>title()</b> specifies a string to be placed in the &lt;TITLE&gt; of the HTML page,
        and on the first line of the body of the page, using a &lt;H2&gt; heading.
<p>
    <b>linesize()</b> specifies a maximum line size for the result, i.e. the width
        in characters of rendered HTML lines. The argument must be between 40
        and 255 inclusive. Default is the current linesize.
<p>
    The remaining options pertain to setting how the HTML page will appear
    when rendered in a browser.
<p>
    <b>percentsize()</b> specifies the scaling of the font to be used on the
        resulting HTML page as a percentage of the default. (The actual size
        is not specified, since it is typically specified by the person using
        the browser, not the person sharing the information.) This affects
        all text on the page.
<p>
    <b>bold</b> specifies that input lines (those resulting from user input),
        results from Stata, and error numbers be displayed as bold text.
<p>
    <b>scheme()</b> is the simplest way to change the colors of the resulting web
        page. The allowable schemes are
<p>
        <b>black</b>, <b>white</b>, or <b>blue</b>, which correspond closely to the
          colors of Stata's color schemes for the results window.
<p>
        <b>yellow</b>, which makes an easy-on-the-eyes page with a faint
          yellow background.
<p>
    <b>input()</b>, <b>result()</b>, <b>text()</b>, and <b>error()</b> can be used independently to set
        the foreground color of the text which corresponds to user input,
        Stata results, plain text output, and error numbers.
<p>
    <b>bg()</b> specifies the color of the background of the page. For convenience,
        this can be given as "grey" or "gray".
<p>
    <b>css()</b> specifies the cascading style sheet for the web page. This is an
        advanced option for people who use CSS for standardizing the
        appearance of their web sites. If you do not know what CSS means,
        there is no need to worry: if this option is omitted, <b>log2html</b> will
        put the proper information into the HTML file it creates.

    . use auto
    . desc
    . summ
    . regress price mpg rep78

    for improvement of this routine.  Renzo Comolli drew our attention to
    problems arising with long lines and quoted filenames. Friedrich Huebler
    also raised the issue of line size and Alan Riley and Joseph Coveney
    showed how to tackle it.
