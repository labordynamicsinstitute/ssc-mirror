<p>
<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    Featured list of LaTeX files in the working directory
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
        <b>ltex</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] <b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>
<p>
    where <i>stub</i> may be a single letter or any combination of characters that
    can be used for filenames.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>ltex</b> returns a list of LaTex files that are stored in the working
    directory. If <i>stub</i> is specified, only files with names containing<i> stub</i>
    are listed. Along with the file names, the programs offer a list of
    click-able links for some typical tasks that one wants to do for LaTeX
    files.
<p>
    Specifically, <b>ltex</b> provides links for viewing, editing, and typesetting
    each of the LaTeX files in the working directory.
<p>
    By default, the Stata do-file editor is invoked when clicking the
    edit-item of the <b>ltex</b>-output. However, you can use a different editor by
    setting the global macro "MYEDITOR" to the command that opens your
    preferred text editor. I, for example, have the line
<p>
        ------------------- profile.do
        <b>global MYEDITOR !emacsclient -n</b>
        -------------------------------
<p>
    in my profile file, which works under Linux. Windows users might prefer
    something along the following lines
<p>
        -------------------- profile.do
        <b>global MYEDITOR winexec textpad</b>
        -------------------------------
<p>
    Note that setting the macro MYEDITOR also affects the editor used to open
    do-files with ldo.
<p>
    Typesetting the LaTeX-file is done with the pdflatex, which produces PDF
    output. After typesetting, the created file is opened immediately.
    Typesetting requires that LaTeX is installed properly on your computer.
    Opening the created PDF requires that a previewer for PDF files is
    installed on the computer. By default, acrobat reader is assumed as
    previewer, but this can be changed by setting the global macro
    "MYPDFVIEWER". I, for example have the
<p>
        ------------------- profile.do
        <b>global MYPDFVIEWER xpdf</b>
        -------------------------------
<p>
    in my profile file.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Technical note</u></b>
<p>
    LaTeX files produced by Stata are often incomplete in the sense that they
    don't have a preamble. Before typesetting <b>ltex</b> therefore looks in the
    first 30 rows of the file whether there is a preamble or not. If not,
    <b>ltex</b> tries to run the file with a minimal preamble. This works sometimes,
    but sometimes not.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b> brings up yet another click-able item which allows to erase files
        on disk. Clicking on that item removes the respective file
        immediately from the disk. The file is not moved to the recycle bin.
        The erase button is printed in red to indicate that it should be
        handled with care.
