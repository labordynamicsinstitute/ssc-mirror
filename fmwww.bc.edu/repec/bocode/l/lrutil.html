Introduction to some logistic regression utilities
----------------------------
<p>
@grfreq@ and
@grlogit@ plot the prevalence and logit of a binary 
variable by another. E.g. asthma by sex.  Useful for 
scale checking.
<p>
@lrplot@
plots the odds ratios from a logistic  regression model 
graphically. Easier to get a quick overview of a model.
<p>
@lrchg@
Computes likelihood ratio tests and changes in coefficients
between models. Useful in model building.
<p>
@lrmatx@
Stores the coefficients from a logistic regression model
as a matrix for easy manipulation.
<p>
@lrint@
Help file with code fragment that shows how to use the 
above to produce an easily interpretable graph of a model
that includes and interaction of a continous and a categorical
variable.
