Remove text up to and including "==" from variable labels 
---------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^labnoeq^ varlist 
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^labnoeq^ removes text up to and including "==" from the variable labels 
of the variables in varlist. The labels of any variables whose labels do 
not contain the text "==" are unaffected. 
<p>
Remarks 
-------
<p>
Some Stata commands generate variables and attach to them variable 
labels of the form 
<p>
        "varname == value" 
        
or of the form 
<p>
        "varname1, varname2 == value" 
<p>
This program offers a way of removing the text up to and including "==".
Note, however, that any variable label which contains "==" will be 
modified. 
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
    . ^tab rep78, gen(rep78_)^  
    . ^labnoeq rep78_?^
<p>
    . ^separate weight, by(foreign)^ 
    . ^labnoeq weight?^
