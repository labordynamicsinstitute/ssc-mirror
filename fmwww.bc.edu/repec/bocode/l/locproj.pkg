d 'LOCPROJ': module to estimate Local Projections
d
d  locproj estimates linear and non-linear Impulse Response
d Functions (IRF) based on the local projections methodology first
d proposed by Jord√† (2005).  The procedure allows easily
d implementation of several options used in the growing literature
d of local projections. It generates temporary variables with the
d necessary transformations of the response variable in order to
d estimate the IRF in the desired transformation option, such as
d levels, logs, differences, log-differences, cumulative changes or
d cumulative log-differences.	It allows choosing different
d estimation methods for both time series and panel data, including
d some instrumental variables methods . It also allows the use of
d marginal effects instead of regression coefficients, which is
d highly convenient when the response variable is binary and the
d user wants to estimate the response as a probability.   It
d reports the IRF, together with its standard error and confidence
d interval, as an output matrix and through an IRF graph. The user
d can easily choose different options for the desired IRF graph, as
d well as several other options to save and use the results.  The
d module also includes a post-estimation command called lpgraph
d that allows plotting together IRFs estimated by different models. d
