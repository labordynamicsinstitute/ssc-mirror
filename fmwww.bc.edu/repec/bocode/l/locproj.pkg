d 'LOCPROJ': module to estimate Local Projections
d
d  locproj estimates linear and non-linear Impulse Response
d Functions (IRF) based on the local projections methodology first
d proposed by Jord√† (2005).  The procedure allows easily
d implementation of several options used in the growing literature
d of local projections. locproj generates temporary variables with
d the necessary transformations of the response variable in order
d to estimate the IRF in the desired transformation option, such as
d levels, logs, differences, log-differences, cumulative changes or
d cumulative log-differences.  For every option, the procedure also
d generates temporary variables with the corresponding
d transformation of the dependent variable needed in case the user
d wants to include lags of the dependent variable that are
d consistent with the chosen transformation. locproj allows the
d user to choose different estimation methods for both time series
d and panel data, including some instrumental variables methods
d currently available in Stata such as ivregress or xtivreg.
d locproj reports the IRF, together with its standard error and
d confidence interval, as an output matrix and through an IRF
d graph.  The user can easily choose different options for the
d desired IRF graph, as well as other options to save and use the
d results. The options allow defining the desired specification in
d a fully automatic or in a more explicit way, with many
d alternatives in between. If the user chooses the automatic
d specification, the syntax is very close to a typical regression
d command in Stata, with the only restriction that LOCPROJ
d interprets the variable that corresponds to the shock (impulse)
d as the one just after the dependent variable or its lagged terms,
d and only that one variable represents the shock. Alternatively,
d the user can choose to explicitly define the shock variable (or
d variables), the number of lags of the shock, the number of lags
d of the dependent variable, and the control variables. As
d mentioned before, the user can play with alternatives between the
d fully automatic or the fully explicit, depending on which option
d is easier or more convenient to use. The explicit option is
d recommended when the shock should include more than one variable,
d for instance, an additional non-linear term, or an interaction
d with another variable. locproj uses the Stata command lincom to
d estimate the response to the shock variable or variables,
d allowing to estimate responses to linear combinations of
d variables, including interactions with factor or continuous
d variables. Importantly, it also allows the use of marginal
d effects instead of regression coefficients, which is highly
d convenient when the response variable is binary and the user
d wants to estimate the response as a probability.  In the latter
d case, locproj makes use of the Stata command margins, which could
d further facilitate the estimation of responses when the shock
d corresponds to an interaction of variables (factor or continuous)
d instead of just a single variable.
