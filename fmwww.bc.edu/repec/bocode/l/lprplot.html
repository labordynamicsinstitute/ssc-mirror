Logistic regression partial residual plots
-------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^lprplot^ indepvar [^,^ ^bw^idth^(^#^)^ graph_options ]
<p>
<p>
Description
------------
<p>
^lprplot^ produces a partial residual plot after ^logistic^ regression.
The plot is computed as described in Landwehr, Pregibon, and Shoemaker (1984).
<p>
Warning:  ^lprplot^ is computationally intensive and may take a long time to
          run.  It uses ^ksm, lowess^ to produce the smoothed plot.  Lowess
          calculations on 1,000 observations, for instance, require estimating
          1,000 regressions.
<p>
Note: ^lprplot^ will not work if ^logistic^ was used with weights.
<p>
<p>
Options
--------
<p>
^bwidth(^#^)^ specifies the bandwidth for smoothing.  Default is 0.8.
    See help @ksm@ for details.
<p>
graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^.
    See help @graph@.

Examples
---------
