<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    Featured list of PDF files in the working directory
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
        <b>lpdf</b> [ <i>stub</i> ] <b>, </b><b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b>
<p>
    where <i>stub</i> may be a single letter or any combination of characters that
    can be used for filenames.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>lpdf</b> returns a list of portable document format files (pdf) that are
    stored in the working directory. If <i>stub</i> is specified, only files with
    names containing<i> stub</i> are listed. Along with the file names, the programs
    offer a list of click-able links for some typical tasks that one wants to
    do for PDF files.
<p>
    Specifically, <b>lpdf</b> provides links for viewing, printing, and
    PostScript-conversion of each of the PDF files in the working directory.
    There is also a link for PostScript conversion of all PDF files shown in
    the list.
<p>
    PDF-conversion of the EPS-files is done with pdftops. This requires that
    pdf2ps is properly installed on your system. Unter Linux/UNIX/Mac this
    should be normaly the case. The same is true for all Windows systems with
    a working installation of MiKTeX on it. After converting the PDF file to
    PS, a link to open the file is created.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>e</u></b><b>rase</b> brings up yet another click-able item which allows to erase files
        on disk. Clicking on that item removes the respective file
        immediately from the disk. The file is not moved to the recycle bin.
        The erase button is printed in red to indicate that it should be
        handled with care.
