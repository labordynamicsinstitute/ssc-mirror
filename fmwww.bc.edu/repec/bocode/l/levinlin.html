<b>levinlin</b> is for use with panel data.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before using
<b>levinlin</b>, using the panel form of <b>tsset</b>; see help tsset.
<p>
<i>varname</i> may contain time-series operators; see help varlist.
<p>
Users of Stata 11+ should use the official <b>xtunitroot llc</b> command.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>levinlin</b> estimates the panel unit root test developed by Levin, Lin and Chu
(LLC, 2002).  The test assumes that each individual unit in the panel shares
the same AR(1) coefficient, but allows for individual effects, time effects and
possibly a time trend. Lags of the dependent variable may be introduced to
allow for serial correlation in the errors. The test may be viewed as a pooled
Dickey-Fuller test, or an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test when lags are
included, with the null hypothesis that of nonstationarity (I(1) behavior).
After transformation by factors provided by LLC, the t-star statistic is
distributed standard normal under the null hypothesis of nonstationarity.
<p>
The test differs from Taylor and Sarno's (1998) multivariate ADF test, 
madfuller, in that the latter is estimated using the seemingly unrelated 
regressions (SUR) estimator (that is, with an equation for each individual) und
&gt; er 
the same constraint of a single autoregressive parameter across individuals. 
The MADF test cannot be employed on large-N, small-T panels, since T must excee
&gt; d N 
in standard SUR. This restriction does not apply to the LLC test.

<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>lags</b> must be specified, and may take on any non-negative value. If a single
    value is provided, that lag length is used for all individuals. If a list
    of lags is provided (perhaps with a local macro), its length must match the
    number of individuals in the panel.
<p>
<b>noconstant</b> omits the constant term from the estimated equation (LLC case 1).
<p>
<b>trend</b> includes a time trend in the estimated equation (LLC case 3).
