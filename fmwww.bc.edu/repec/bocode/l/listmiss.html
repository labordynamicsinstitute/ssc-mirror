    <b>Analyse missing values related to an estimation command</b>

<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
        <b>listmiss</b> [<i>varlist</i>] [<i>if</i>] [<i>in</i>]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
    <b>listmiss</b> is a post-estimation command that reports the number of missing
    values for each independent variable.  For each independent variable a
    flag is created to indicate when the variable is missing.  The dependent
    variable is regressed on the missing flag for each independent variable.
    The statistical significance of the slope is reported as an indicator of
    whether the dependent variable is statistically different where an
    independent variable is missing.  Another test compares the null model to
    the model with the missing flag and performs a BIC difference test, again
    as an indication of whether the dependent variable is statistically
    different when an independent variable is missing.  If the model was
    specified with robust standard errors, then robust standard errors are
    used to perform the hypothesis test related to the slope for the missing
    value flag.
