Description
-----------
<p>
^alphlist^ produces the letters of the English alphabet ^a^ ... ^z^ [ ^_^ ] 
or ^A^ ... ^Z^ [ ^_^] as a list of separate words.    
<p>
^binolist^ produces binomial coefficients as a list of separate words. 
<p>
^bothlist^ produces the list of words that are in both list1 and list2. 
Repeated occurrences are selected only once. ^bothlist a b c d \ d e g^ 
produces ^d^. 
<p>
^choplist^ chops a list of words into two lists according to a stated
criterion. 
<p>
^collist^ displays a list in column form: each word is printed starting on 
a new line.
<p>
^convlist^ produces the convolution of two numlists. Given a_1, ... , a_m 
and b_1, ... , b_n the convolution is c_k, k = 1, ... , m + n - 1, where c_k 
is the sum of products a_i * b_j such that i + j - 1 = k. More graphically, 
consider this table of indexes k for a list of 3 items, indexed by i, and a 
list of 4 items, indexed by j. 
<p>
                j
            1  2  3  4  
          +-----------          
        1 | 1  2  3  4  
     i  2 | 2  3  4  5
        3 | 3  4  5  6
<p>
In words, form a multiplication table, and take sums over rising 
diagonals. Thus the convolution of 1 2 1 and 1 3 3 1 is 
1 (2 + 3) (1 + 6 + 3) (3 + 6 + 1) (3 + 2) 1 = 1 5 10 10 5 1. 
<p>
^cseplist^ interpolates commas as separators between words in the list. 
<p>
^cvarlist^ selects from a list of words those that are names of variables. 
<p>
^dellist^ deletes from a list of words any that contain one or more 
specified words, or any at specified positions. 
<p>
^difflist^ produces a list of words that are in list1 but not in list2. 
Repeated occurrences are selected only once. ^difflist a b c \ b^ 
produces ^a c^. 
<p>
^eqlist^ determines whether two lists are equal, that is, have the 
same words in the same order. 
<p>
^fmtlist^ produces a list of words displayed according to a specified 
format. Most commonly, this is used for rounding to a specified number 
of decimal places. 
<p>
^inslist^ inserts words in the list at specified positions. 
<p>
^joinlist^ joins or juxtaposes corresponding words from two lists. The lists 
should have equal numbers of words, except that any list of length 1 is 
repeated to match the other. Given ^a1 a2 a3 \ b1 b2 b3^, ^joinlist^ produces 
^a1b1 a2b2 a3b3^ by default and ^a1 b1 a2 b2 a3 b3^ with the ^sep^ option. 
Given ^a1 a2 a3 \ X^, it produces ^a1X a2X a3X^ by default. 
<p>
^lclist^ converts each word in the list to lower case.
<p>
^maplist^ evaluates an expression substituting each word in turn. The 
expression may return a numeric or a string result.
<p>
^mnthlist^ produces a list of months. 
<p>
^poslist^ produces a list of positions of words in list1 that are in list2. 
The position is that of the first occurrence of a word in list2. Words in list2
&gt;  
that are not in list1 are assigned position ^0^. ^poslist a b c c d \ b c e^ 
produces ^2 3 0^.
<p>
^postlist^ produces a list of words all followed by the specified string. 
^postlist a b c, p(70)^ produces ^a70 b70 c70^. 
<p>
^prelist^ produces a list of words all preceded by the specified string. 
^prelist a b c, p(70)^ produces ^70a 70b 70c^. 
<p>
^prodlist^ produces the product of a numlist. 
<p>
^replist^ replicates a list of words. 
<p>
^revlist^ reverses a list of words.
<p>
^rotlist^ rotates a list of words. 
<p>
^sellist^ selects from a list of words any that contain one or more specified 
words. 
<p>
^seqlist^ produces by default a list of words suffixed by successive integers,
such as stub^1^, stub^2^, ... Note that stub can be blank (an empty string). 
For further details see under Options.
<p>
^sortlist^ sorts a list of words into alphabetic order. 
<p>
^sublist^ removes the string specified by ^from( )^ from each of the 
words in the list provided. It replaces that string by any string specified 
by ^to( )^. ^to( )^ defaults to an empty string. If the string specified by 
^from( )^ is equal to the whole word, it is in effect removed from the list.
<p>
^sumlist^ produces the sum of a numlist. 
<p>
^takelist^ yields the words at the specified positions in the list. 
<p>
^trnclist^ truncates each word, either so that it is no longer than ^length( )^
&gt;  
characters, or so that the last ^number( )^ characters are dropped. 
<p>
^uclist^ converts each word in the list to upper case.
<p>
^uniqlist^ deletes from a list of words any but the first occurrence 
of each word in the list.
<p>
^varflist^ generates a new variable from a list, putting successive words 
in successive observations, starting at 1. 
<p>
^vectlist^ puts the elements of a named vector into a list. 
<p>
^wclist^ counts the number of words in a list.
<p>
^xorlist^ selects words that occur in either but not both of two lists
(symmetric difference of sets). ^xorlist a b c \ c d e^ selects ^a b d e^.
Note that ^xorlist^ yields an empty list if and only if two lists 
contain the same words (not necessarily in the same order). 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
`Words' are separated by spaces. No significance is attached to the number 
of spaces. No commas or ^" "^ should be included. In the case of ^bothlist^, 
^convlist^, ^difflist^, ^eqlist^, ^joinlist^, ^poslist^ and ^xorlist^, ^\^ 
should not be included. Hence ^a b c^ is a list of three words, ^a^, ^b^ 
and ^c^. Similarly, ^1 2 3^ is a list of three words, ^1^, ^2^ and ^3^.
<p>
Position in the list is best explained by example. In the list ^a b c^, the 
words ^a^, ^b^, ^c^ have positions ^1^, ^2^, ^3^, and also ^-3^, ^-2^, ^-1^. Th
&gt; us 
negative positions are counted backwards from the end of the list and 
position ^-1^ refers to the last word. It is not an error to refer to 
position ^0^ but the result is empty. 
<p>
^choplist^ with ^length( )^ or ^char( )^, ^dellist, delete( )^, ^eqlist^, ^lcli
&gt; st^, 
^sellist^, ^sortlist^, ^sublist^, ^trnclist^, ^uclist^ and ^varflist^ cannot 
handle lists containing any individual word longer than 80 characters. 
<p>
^maplist^ may produce undesired results if expressions returning string 
results contain or would return any strings longer than 80 characters. 
Expressions are not currently checked for this problem. 
<p>
Any list given as input may be specified by one or more local or global 
macros. 
<p>
The list might be a list of variable names, for example, but note that 
these programs do not treat wild cards or dashes in variable lists in 
any special way. Similarly, as a general rule, these programs do not 
expand number lists (numlists) given as the main argument. Exceptions 
are ^convlist^, ^prodlist^ and ^sumlist^. 
<p>
A word contains a string if ^index("^word^","^string^") &gt; 0^.
<p>
^wclist^ allows two statements of the form 
<p>
    ^local nw : word count^ list 
    ^di `nw'^ 
        
to be replaced by one statement.        
<p>
^lclist^ and ^uclist^ are needed for lists more than 80 characters long, 
because, for example, ^local lower = lower("^string^")^ truncates strings 
that long. However, for the same reason, ^lclist^ and ^uclist^ cannot handle 
individual words more than 80 characters long. Naturally, this is less 
of a restriction. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
- options for all commands except ^collist^ and ^varflist^ 
<p>
^noisily^ specifies that the resulting list(s) should be displayed.
<p>
^global( )^ specifies a global macro name to hold the resulting list. 
<p>
However, the ^global^ option of ^choplist^ and ^cvarlist^ may contain either 
one or two names. The first name (of either one or two) will be used to hold 
the words selected by the stated criterion. Any second name will be used to 
hold the words not selected. 
<p>
Note that the ^global^ option of ^varflist^, which does not take 
an argument, has a different function. 
<p>
- options specific to ^alphlist^ 
<p>
^capitals^ specifies that the list should be ^A^ ... ^Z^ rather than the 
default ^a^ ... ^z^.
<p>
^underscore^ adds ^_^ to the list. 
<p>
- option specific to ^binolist^ 
<p>
^k(^#^)^ specifies that the binomal coefficients should be ^comb(^k - 1, i - 1^
&gt; )^ 
for i = 1, ... , k and integer k &gt;= 1. ^k(5)^ produces ^1 4 6 4 1^. It is a 
required option. 
<p>
- options specific to ^choplist^ 
<p>
^pos( )^ specifies a criterion for selecting words according to their 
positions. ^pos(&lt;=3)^ puts the first three words in list 1, and any others 
in list 2. 
<p>
^length( )^ specifies a criterion for selecting words according to their 
lengths. ^length(7)^ puts words of length &lt;= 7 in list 1, and any others in 
list 2.
<p>
^value( )^ specifies a criterion for selecting words according to their 
values. Words may be compared according to their numeric or string order. 
<p>
^char(^#^)^ specifies that the first # characters of each word be selected. 
^char(1)^ puts the first character of each word in list 1, and any others 
in list 2. If # is negative, the last # characters of each word will be 
selected. ^char(-1)^ puts the last character of each word in list 1, and 
any others in list 2. Note that list 1 and list 2 will contain the same 
number of words if and only if every word is at least two characters long. 
<p>
Precisely one of ^pos( )^, ^length( )^, ^value( )^ or ^char( )^ should be 
specified. With the first three options, if just a number is specified, 
^&lt;=^ is prefixed, except that with ^pos( )^ if a negative sign is detected, 
^&gt;=^ is prefixed. ^pos(3)^ and ^pos(&lt;=3)^ are thus equivalent, as are 
similar choices with ^length( )^ and ^value( )^. ^pos(-1)^ puts the last 
word in list 1, and all others in list 2. 
<p>
- options specific to ^collist^ 
<p>
^format( )^ specifies a format to use for each word. See help for @format@. 
<p>
^number^ specifies that words should be numbered from 1 upwards. 
<p>
- options specific to ^cvarlist^ 
<p>
^new^, ^numeric^ and ^string^ specify that words are to be selected if they 
are the names of new, numeric or string variables respectively. Only one 
of these options may be specified. Otherwise the names of variables in 
memory will be selected. 
<p>
- options specific to ^dellist^ 
<p>
^delete(^string^)^ specifies the words to be deleted. By default a word in 
the list is deleted if it contains any of the words in ^delete( )^. Thus 
^dellist abc bcd c d e, d(a b c)^ deletes ^abc bcd c^. 
<p>
^all^ specifies that to be deleted each word must contain all the words 
in ^delete( )^. Thus ^dellist abc bcd c d e, d(a b c) all^ deletes ^abc^.
<p>
^exact^ specifies that exact matches are required. Words will be deleted 
only if they equal the specified word. 
<p>
^all^ may not be specified with ^exact^.
<p>
^pos( )^ should contain a numlist of positions of words to be deleted. 
<p>
Either ^delete( )^ or ^pos( )^ must be specified. 
<p>
- option specific to ^fmtlist^ 
<p>
^format(^format^)^ specifies a format. It is a required option. 
See help for @format@.
<p>
- options specific to ^inslist^ 
<p>
^inslist^ inserts words from ^insert( )^ as separate words at positions 
in the original list given by ^pos( )^. 
<p>
^insert( )^ should contain one or more space-separated words. 
<p>
^pos( )^ should contain a numlist of positions. Position # means after word # 
in the original list or before word # + 1. Thus ^0^ means before word 1, ^1^ me
&gt; ans 
after word 1, and ^-1^ means after the last word. Numbers may be repeated. 
<p>
If the number of words in ^insert( )^ is less than the number 
of positions, ^insert( )^ is expanded as required. 
<p>
For example, ^inslist a b c d e f g h , i(x) p(1/7)^ produces 
<p>
^a x b x c x d x e x f x g x h^ 
<p>
while ^inslist a b c d e f g h , i(( )) p(0 4 4 8)^ produces 
<p>
^( a b c d ) ( e f g h)^ 
<p>
- option specific to ^joinlist^ 
<p>
^sep^ specifies that words produced are to be separate, that is, 
juxtaposed not joined. 
<p>
- options specific to ^maplist^ 
<p>
^map(^expression^)^ specifies an expression which is evaluated using each word 
in turn. It is a required option. The expression may return either a numeric 
or a string result. The expression must contain a particular symbol (default 
^@@^) which is used as a placeholder for the word. Thus ^map(-@@)^ negates each
word; ^map(sqrt(@@))^ calculates the square root of each word; ^map("foo @@")^ 
interpolates ^foo^ as a separate word before each word in the list. 
<p>
^symbol(^string^)^ specifies an alternative to ^@@^ as a placeholder for 
each word. Thus ^map(sqrt(X)) sy(X)^ is equivalent to ^map(sqrt(@@))^. 
<p>
- options specific to ^mnthlist^ 
<p>
^begin(^str^)^ specifies a month to start the sequence. str can be an integer 
between 1 and 12, indicating a month from January (1) to December (12), or
an unambiguous English month name or abbreviation (case is not important). 
Thus a string starting with any of "ja", "Ja", "JA", or "jA" is taken to mean 
January. January is the default. 
<p>
^number(^#^)^ specifies the number of months in the list. 12 is the default. 
<p>
^step(^#^)^ specifies the step between successive months in the list. 
1 is the default.
<p>
^long^ indicates long names (january ... december or January ... December). 
Three letter abbreviations jan ... dec are the default. 
<p>
^caplc^ indicates an initial capital followed by lower case, as in January ...
December or Jan ... Dec. All lower case is the default. 
<p>
^uppercase^ indicates all upper case, as in JANUARY ... DECEMBER or 
JAN ... DEC. All lower case is the default. 
<p>
^year^ indicates the year in which in the first month occurs. Years will 
be appended to each month. 
<p>
Thus ^mnthlist^ produces ^jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec^. 
<p>
^mnthlist, n(49) b(3) s(12) year(1952) caplc^ produces the 49 months 
^Mar1952 Mar1953^ ... ^Mar1999 Mar2000^. 
<p>
- options specific to ^postlist^
<p>
^post(^string^)^ specifies the string to be postfixed.  It is a required 
option.
<p>
^sep^ specifies that whatever is postfixed by ^postlist^ is a separator 
and should not appear after the last word in the list. 
^postlist a b c, p(,) sep^ produces the list ^"a, b, c"^.
<p>
- option specific to ^prelist^ 
<p>
^pre(^string^)^ specifies the string to be prefixed. It is a required 
option.
<p>
- options specific to ^replist^
<p>
^copies(^#^)^ specifies the number of copies to be produced. 
By itself ^copies(3)^ produces ^a a a b b b c c c^ given ^a b c^. 
It is a required option. 
<p>
^block^ specifies that the list is to be replicated as a block. 
^copies(3) block^ produces ^a b c a b c a b c^ given ^a b c^. 
<p>
- option specific to ^rotlist^ 
<p>
^rot(^#^)^ rotates the list as follows. Suppose there are n words in the 
list and ^rot(^r^)^ is specified. If r &gt;= 0, the new list is the last n - r 
words of the list followed by the first r words: that is, r words from 
the start of the list are moved to the end. If r &lt; 0, the new list is the 
last r words of the list followed by the first n - r words: that is, r words 
from the end of the list are moved to the start. Thus given ^1 2 3 4 5^, 
^rot(1)^ produces ^2 3 4 5 1^ and ^rot(-1)^ produces ^5 1 2 3 4^. For any 
integer r, ^mod(^r^,^n^)^ is used. 
<p>
- options specific to ^sellist^
<p>
^select(^string^)^ specifies the words to be selected. It is a required 
option. By default a word in the list is selected if it contains any 
of the words in ^select( )^. Thus ^sellist abc bcd c d e, s(a b c)^ 
produces ^abc bcd c^. With any of ^prefix^, ^postfix^ or ^suffix select( )^ 
must contain only a single word. 
<p>
^exact^ specifies that exact matches are required. Words will be selected 
only if they equal the specified word. 
<p>
^all^ specifies that to be selected each word must contain all the words 
in ^select^. Thus ^sellist abc bcd c d e, s(a b c) all^ produces ^abc^. 
<p>
^all^ may not be specified with ^exact^. 
<p>
^prefix^ specifies that to be selected each word must contain the single 
word in ^select( )^ as a prefix, at its start. 
Thus ^sellist abc bcd c d e, s(c) pre^ produces ^c^. 
<p>
^postfix^ or ^suffix^ specifies that to be selected each word must contain 
the single word in ^select( )^ as a postfix or suffix, at its end.  
Thus ^sellist abc bcd c d e, s(c) post^ produces ^abc c^. 
<p>
^prefix^ may not be combined with ^postfix^ or ^suffix^. None of these options 
may be combined with ^exact^ or ^all^. 
<p>
- options specific to ^seqlist^ 
<p>
^copies(^#^)^ specifies the number of words in the list to be produced. 
By itself ^copies(3)^ produces stub^1^ stub^2^ stub^3^. It is a required 
option. 
<p>
^start(^#^)^ specifies a starting number other than 1. ^copies(3) start(3)^ 
produces stub^3^ stub^4^ stub^5^. 
<p>
^prefix^ specifies that numbers are to be attached as prefixes. 
^copies(3) prefix^ produces ^1^stub ^2^stub ^3^stub. 
<p>
^postfix(^string^)^ specifies a postfix to be added to all words. 
^post(b)^ adds ^b^ to the end of each word. 
<p>
- options specific to ^sublist^
<p>
^from(^string^)^ specifies the string to be substituted.  It is a required
option.
<p>
^to(^string^)^ optionally specifies a replacement string to be used by 
^sublist^. In other words, it defaults to an empty string, and in that case 
^sublist^ deletes the argument of ^from( )^ from each word in the list
without replacing it. 
<p>
^all^ specifies that all occurrences of string in each word are to 
be substituted by ^sublist^. The default is to substitute the first 
occurrence only. 
<p>
- option specific to ^takelist^
<p>
^pos(^numlist of positions^)^ specifies the positions of the words to be taken 
from the list.
<p>
- options specific to ^trnclist^
<p>
^length(^#^)^ specifies the maximum length of word acceptable. With 
^length(8)^, for example, words of 8 or fewer characters are unchanged, 
while words of 9 or more characters are truncated to the first 8 
characters. 
<p>
^number(^#^)^ specifies the number of characters to be dropped from the 
end of each word. ^number(^1^)^ drops the last character from each word. 
Dropping # characters from a word # or fewer characters long blanks it out.
<p>
- options specific to ^varflist^

^generate(^newvar^)^ specifies the name of a new variable to receive 
values. It is a required option.
<p>
^global^ indicates that the list is of global names, whose values are to be 
put in the new variable. ^varflist a b c, g(foo) global^ is equivalent to 
^varflist $a $b $c, g(foo)^. Conversely, to put the names of globals ^a b c^
in a new variable, do not specify ^global^. 
<p>
^scalar^ indicates that the list is of scalar names, whose values are to be 
put in the new variable. ^varflist a b c, g(foo) scalar^ puts the values of 
scalars with names ^a b c^ in ^foo^. Conversely, to put the names of scalars 
^a b c^ in a new variable, do not specify ^scalar^.
<p>
^global^ and ^scalar^ may not be combined. 
<p>
^string^ specifies that the new variable is to be a string variable. 
^string^ without ^type( )^ implies ^str1^, so that ^type( )^ is not required 
with ^string^. However, a numeric data type must not be specified with 
^string^. 
<p>
^type(^variable_type^)^ specifies the type as which the new variable is 
first created. See ^string^ above.

This set of programs has benefitted from questions and comments from 
several members of Statalist, especially Kit Baum, for encouragement 
and suggestions; Austin Frakt, for unearthing an important bug; and 
Fred Wolfe, who provided the stimulus to extend ^dellist^ and ^sellist^.
