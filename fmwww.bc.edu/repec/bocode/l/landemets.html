<p>
    <b>landemets</b> computes boundaries for group sequential clinical trials using
    the method of Lan and DeMets (1983).
<p>
<a name="remarks"></a><b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>landemets</b> requires that the Stata module -moremata- (Jann, 2005) be
    installed.
<p>
<a name="examples"></a><b><u>Examples</u></b> 
<p>
    Compute boundaries with the default options:
        <b>. landemets</b>
<p>
    Ten equally spaced monitoring times between 0.1 and 1:
        <b>. landemets, t(0.1(0.1)1)</b>
<p>
    The same, but plotting the boundaries:
        <b>. landemets, t(0.1(0.1)1) plot</b>
<p>
    Type I error probability set to 0.01, with a different choice of four,
    not equally spaced times:
        <b>. landemets, t(0.2 0.3 0.5 1) alpha(0.01)</b>
<p>
    The same, but using a Pocock type alpha spending function:
        <b>. landemets, t(0.2 0.3 0.5 1) alpha(0.01) method(poc)</b>
<p>
    One-sided boundaries using an alpha spending function in the power
    family, with parameter set to 1.5:
        <b>. landemets, t(0.2(0.2)1) method(pow) rho(1.5) onesided</b>
<p>
    Two-sided asymmetric boundaries; the total type I error probability,
    0.05, is divided in 0.04 and 0.01 for the lower and upper boundaries,
    respectively; an O'Brien-Fleming type alpha spending function is used for
    both boundaries:
        <b>. landemets, t(0.2(0.2)1) alpha(0.04, 0.01) method(obf obf)</b>
<p>
    Two-sided asymmetric boundaries; the total type I error probability,
    0.05, is equally divided between the lower and upper boundaries, but
    different alpha spending functions are used for each boundary (lower:
    power family, with rho = 2, upper:  O'Brien-Fleming type):
        <b>. landemets, t(0.2(0.2)1) alpha(0.025, 0.025) method(pow obf) rho(2)</b>
<p>
<a name="options"></a><b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>t(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> specifies the times at which analyses are to be performed.
        They must be contained in (0,1], and the maximum value should be 1.
        The default is <b>t(1)</b>, meaning no interim analyses.
<p>
    <b>alpha(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> specifies the type I error probability. The <i>numlist</i> may be
        of length one or two. If it has only one value, two-sided (symmetric)
        or one-sided stopping boundaries for a type I error probability equal
        to that value are computed (whether two-sided or one-sided boundaries
        are computed is controlled by the <b>onesided</b> option; see below). If the
        length of <i>numlist</i> is two, its components give the type I error
        probability for, respectively, the lower and upper boundaries. Thus,
        if the two alpha values or the alpha spending function used for each
        boundary are different (see the <b>method</b> option below), asymmetric
        two-sided boundaries are obtained. The default is <b>alpha(0.05)</b>.
<p>
    <b>method(</b><i>method</i><b>)</b> specifies the alpha spending function(s) to be used. The
        accepted arguments are:
        a) one of <b>obf</b> (O'Brien-Fleming type), <b>poc</b>(Pocock type), or <b>pow</b> (power
            family). This is the way to specify the alpha spending function
            for symmetric two-sided or one-sided boundaries. When the method
            is thus specified, the argument of the <b>alpha</b> option must be of
            length one.
        b) any two (possibly repeated) values in a) separated by one or more
            spaces. This is the way to specify the alpha spending functions
            used for each boundary (the first word for the lower boundary,
            the second word for the upper one) for asymmetric boundaries.
            When the method is thus specified, the argument of the <b>alpha</b>
            option must be of length two.
        The default is<b> method(obf)</b>. For details on the types of alpha
        spending functions see, e.g., Cook and DeMets, 2008.
<p>
    <b>rho(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> specifies the parameter(s) of the power family alpha
        spending function(s). The <i>numlist</i> may be of length one or two,
        depending on how many alpha spending functions of this type are
        specified by the <b>method</b> option.
<p>
    <b>onesided</b> specifies if one-sided, instead of two-sided boundaries, are to
        be computed.
<p>
    <b>plot</b> specifies if a plot of stopping boundaries vs. monitoring times is
        to be displayed.
