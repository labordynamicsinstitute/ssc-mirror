Define value labels for log base 10 numbers 
-------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^lablog^ valuelabelname ^, v^alues^(^numlist^)^ [ ^m^ax^(^#^) l^ist ] 
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^lablog^ defines value labels for values which are base 10 logarithms
containing the antilogged values. 
<p>
The ^label define^ ... ^, modify^ command that defines the labels is 
echoed to the monitor. 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
Suppose you have a variable which contains numbers which are base 10 
logarithms of some other numbers. On a graph you wish to have labelling 
in the original antilogged or exponentiated scale, so that 0 appears as 1, 
1 as 10, -1 as 0.1, and so forth. ^lablog^ is designed for this problem. 
<p>
^lablog logs, v(1/6)^ for example is equivalent to 
<p>
^label def logs 1 "10" 2 "100" 3 "1000" 4 "10000" 5 "100000" 6 "1000000"^ 
          ^, modify^ 
          
after which you may attach the value labels in ^logs^ to one or more 
variables. 
<p>
The format here with each zero digit explicit may be unacceptable for very 
big or very small numbers. By default labels for integers &gt;= 7 or &lt;= -7 
are defined as powers of 10 such as ^"10^^7"^ or ^"10^^-7"^. The threshold 
at which this change of format takes place may be tuned by the option 
^max( )^. 
<p>
Note that Stata does not permit value labels to be attached to non-integers. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^values(^numlist^)^ specifies a numlist of integers whose value labels are 
    to be modified (added or changed). This is a required option. 
<p>
^max(^#^)^ specifies a maximum level at which the format of the value 
    labels changes to powers of 10 rather than numbers with each zero 
    digit specified. ^max(5)^ would mean that the value labels for 4, 5, 
    -4 and -5 would be ^"10000"^, ^"10^^5"^, ^"0.0001"^ and ^"10^^-5"^,  
    respectively. See also Remarks above.
<p>
^list^ invokes ^label list^ valuelabelname after the modifications.
