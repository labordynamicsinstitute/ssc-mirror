<b><u>Translate a SMCL log file into HTML</u></b>

<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b> 
<p>
<b>log2html7</b> is for use after <b>log</b>; see log. If you are using Stata 8 or later, use
<b>log2html</b> instead.
<p>
<b>log2html7</b> makes use of an undocumented command in Stata version 7, <b>log html</b>,
which generates HTML log files from SMCL log files. SMCL, the Stata Markup and
Control Language smcl, is the default log file format introduced with version
7, and contains markup (similar to HTML) around elements of the log file. To
use <b>log2html7</b>, you must first generate the default SMCL log file, not a text
log file, with the file extension <b>.smcl</b>.  Thus if you have <b>set logtype text</b> to
prevent the generation of SMCL log files, you must either turn it off or
explicitly state that a SMCL log file is to be produced, as by<b> log using</b>
<b>my.smcl</b>.
<p>
<b>log2html7</b> requires only the base name of the logfile: e.g. <b>my</b>, if the logfile
is named <b>my.smcl</b>. The name of the HTML file produced will be this base name
with <b>.html</b> appended, e.g. <b>my.html</b>.
<p>
<b>log2html7</b> requires that at least the 6 December 2001 update to Stata version 7
be installed. If a message "Invalid syntax" is encountered, please ensure that
<b>query born</b> returns a date no earlier than 06 Dec 2001.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Limitation</u></b> 
<p>
<b>log2html7</b> cannot reliably echo <i>names</i> of local or global macros given on command
lines in the log. This is because before being passed to the Stata command
<b>file</b>, which does most of the hard work within <b>log2html7</b>, they are caught by
Stata's parser and substituted with their current <i>contents</i>, if any. The usual
result is to replace macro names with empty strings, although on occasion you
may be fortunate enough to have the correct contents of a macro substituted, or
unfortunate enough to have something quite different substituted, if the
contents of a macro have changed since the log was created. This behavior is
outside the control of the program authors, who know of no work-around in Stata
7.  The limitation does not apply to <b>log2html</b> used in conjunction with Stata 8
or higher.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>replace</b> specifies that if the HTML file exists, it is to be replaced.
<p>
<b>title()</b> specifies a string to be placed in the &lt;TITLE&gt; of the HTML page, and on
    the first line of the body of the page, using a &lt;H2&gt; heading.
<p>
The remaining options pertain to color choices. By default, <b>loghtml</b> produces a
complete HTML page (i.e. with &lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; tags) with a white background.
Input lines (those resulting from user input) are rendered in RGB color
"CC6600" (a shade of brown) and highlighted result-window lines are rendered in
RGB color "000099" (a shade of blue).  The options permit other choices for
these three colors. For best results, one of the 216 "web safe" colors that
display properly in web browsers on all computers in 256-color mode should be
used. Also note that some combinations of colors are not workable; e.g. a black
("000000") background will cause all normally-rendered text to disappear.
<p>
<b>input()</b> allows the specification of a different color for the user input lines,
    in standard RGB notation (three duples of two bytes, each 00-FF).
<p>
<b>result()</b> allows the specification of a different color for the highlighted
    result lines, in standard RGB notation.
<p>
<b>bg()</b> allows the specification of a different color for the background, in
    standard RGB notation. For convenience, the argument may be given as "gray"
    or "grey", approximating most browsers' default behavior.
