d 'LOGITJACK': module to provide cluster robust inference for logit models
d
d      logitjack is a stand-alone command that calculates a
d linearized version of the wild cluster bootstrap for logit
d models.    It will calculate a CV1 variance estimate, with
d p-values calculated using the t(G-1) distribution for the
d t-statistics.    Native Stata uses the t(N-k) distribution which
d usually results in over-rejection of the null hypothesis.
d logitjack    calculates a jackknife variance for the linearized
d model, CV3L, which in practice is very similar to the
d computationally    demandind CV3 variance. logitjack also
d optionally calculates the brute-force cluster jackknife CV3
d variance estimator for    logit models.
