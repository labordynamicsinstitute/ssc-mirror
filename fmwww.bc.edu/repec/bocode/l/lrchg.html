Calculates change in coefficients between logistic models 
----------------------------
<p>
    ^lrchg^ , store(n)
        or
    ^lrchg^ , contr(n m)
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^lrchg^ displays the coefficients in two logistic models, and
calculates the proportion of change in coefficients between two
models.
<p>
This is useful in logistic regression modelling in epidemiology.
<p>
Use 
    ^lrchg^ , store(1) 
    ^lrchg^ , store(2) 
    ^lrchg^ , contr(1 2) 
<p>
to store two models, then contrast them.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
store(n)
   Stores logistic regression results in a variable coeffn
   Use before contrasting two models.
<p>
contr(n m)
   Contrasts two models previously stored.         
<p>
nocoeff
   Drop the calculations of changes in coefficients.
   
Examples
--------
<p>
. xi: logistic response i.agek6 i.gend i.agek6*i.gend i.regio 
. lrchg, store(0)
. xi: logistic response i.agek6 i.gend i.agek6*i.gend
. lrchg, store(1)
. lrchg, contr(0 1)

Remarks 
-------
Presently the coefficients are stored in matrices named
coeff`n'. This shouldn't cause any problems, but it is
not elegant.
<p>
It might be better to use -estimates hold-  but will 
have to get back to this.
<p>
The author wonders what to do if there are zero degrees 
of freedom ?
