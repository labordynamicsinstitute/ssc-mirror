Tabulation using categories defined by fractions of a cut-off value
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
^xfrac^ varname [fweights aweights] [^if^ exp ^in^ range]
                        , ^cut^off^(^#^)^ [ ^gp(^gpname^)^ ]
<p>
Description
-----------
^xfrac^ provides a specialized tabulation (a 'wrapper' for -tabulate-).
Each valid observation is first partitioned by varname into one of a set
of 20 mutually-exclusive categories, the boundaries of which are defined 
by 'hard-wired' fractions of a user-specified cut-off value (in the same
units as varname), with fractions ranging from 0.1 through to 3.0. This 
classification is then tabulated and, optionally, can be retained 
as a new variable.
<p>
In effect ^xfrac^ provides a discrete representation of the distribution 
function for varname.
<p>
Example: let varname be a measure of income and the cut-off be mean
income. ^xfrac^ shows the proportion of observations with income
less than 10% of mean income, between 10% and 20% of mean income, 
between 20% and 30% of mean income, and so on (20 categories). 
Cumulative proportions are also shown.
<p>
Mandatory
---------
^cut^off^(^#^)^  The user must specify a value for the cut-off value
                 (in the same units as varname).
<p>
Options
-------
^gp(^gpname^)^ creates a new categorical variable, gpname, containing
              categories summarising group membership.
<p>
Example
-------
. ^sum x [aw=wgt]^
. ^local mean = _result(3)^
. ^xfrac x [aw=wgt], cut(`mean') gp(gpname)^
