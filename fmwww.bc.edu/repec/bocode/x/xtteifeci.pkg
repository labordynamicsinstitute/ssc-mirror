d 'XTTEIFECI': module to provide Estimation and Inference of Treatment Effects through a Factor-Based Approach
d
d   xtteifeci is designed for estimation and inference of treatment
d effects and provides nonparametric confidence intervals for panel
d data models with interactive fixed effects as proposed by Li et
d al. (2024), which augments the works of Gobillon and Magnac
d (2016), Xu (2017), and Bai and Ng (2021). xtteifeci supports
d statistical inference through reporting confidence intervals and
d p-values, applicable to models with diverse specifications,
d including those with or without covariates and/or nonstationary
d trends. For detailed guidance on the usage of xtteifeci, see Yan
d et al. (2024).
