    <b>xtcsd</b> is a post-estimation command for use with cross-section time-series
        data following <b>fe</b> or <b>re</b> models.  You must tsset your data before
        using <b>xtcsd</b>; see help tsset.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
        
    <b>xtcsd</b> tests for cross-sectional dependence in Fixed Effects of Random
    Effects panel data models.  One of method's options <b>pesaran</b> <b>friedman</b> or
    <b>frees</b> must be specified.
<p>
        
    A standard assumption in panel data models (xtreg) is that the error
    terms are independent across cross-sections.  This assumption is employed
    for identification purposes rather than descriptive accuracy. In the
    context of large T and small N, the LM test statistic proposed by Breusch
    and Pagan (1980) can be used to test for cross-sectional dependence (see
    help xttest2). However, in most cases, cross-sectional time-series data
    sets come in the form of small T and large N. In this case the
    Breusch-Pagan test is not valid.
<p>
        
    <b>xtcsd</b> test the hypothesis of cross-sectional independence in panel data
    models with small T and large N by implementing two semi-parametric tests
    proposed by Friedman (1937) and Frees (1995,2004), as well as the
    parametric testing procedure proposed by Pesaran (2004).  <b>xtcsd</b> with
    option <b>pesaran</b> can handle balanced as well as unbalanced panels.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
        
    <b>pesaran</b> test for cross-sectional dependence following the methods shown
        in Pesaran (2004). Pesaran's statistic follows a standard normal
        distribution and it is able to handle balanced and unbalanced panels.
<p>
        
    <b>friedman</b> test for cross-sectional dependence using Friedman's chi-square
        distributed statistic.  For unbalanced panels Friedman's test uses
        only the observations available for all cross-sectional units.
<p>
        
    <b>frees</b> test for cross-sectional dependence using Frees' Q distribution
        (T-asymptotically distributed).  For unbalanced panels Frees' test
        uses only the observations available for all cross-sectional units.
<p>
        
    <b>abs</b> computes the average absolute value of the off-diagonal elements of
        the cross-sectional correlation matrix of residuals.
<p>
        
    <b>show</b> shows the cross-sectional correlation matrix of residuals.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Notes</u></b>
<p>
        
    The small sample comparative performance of these tests under various
        model specifications is examined in Sarafidis and De Hoyos (2006).
