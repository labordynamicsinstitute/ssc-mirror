    <b>xtwest</b> is for use with panel data.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before using
    <b>xtwest</b>; see help tsset.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<p>
    <b>xtwest</b> implements the four panel cointegration tests developed by
    Westerlund (2007). The underlying idea is to test for the absence of
    cointegration by determining whether there exists error correction for
    individual panel members or for the panel as a whole.  Consider following
    error correction model, where all variables in levels are assumed to be
    I(1):
<p>
        D.y_it = c_i + a_i1*D.y_it-1 + a_i2*D.y_it-2 + ... +  a_ip*D.y_it-p
<p>
                     + b_i0*D.x_it + b_i1*D.x_it-1 + ... + b_ip*D.x_it-p
<p>
                     + a_i(y_it-1 - b_i*x_it-1) + u_it
<p>
    a_i provides an estimate of the speed of error-correction towards the
    long run equilibrium y_it = - (b_i/a_i) * x_it for that series i. The Ga
    and Gt test statistics test H0: a_i = 0 for all i versus H1: a_i &lt; 0 for
    at least one i. These statistics start from a weighted average of the
    individualy estimated a_i's and their t-ratio's respectively. Rejection
    of H0 should therefore be taken as evidence of cointegration of at least
    one of the cross-sectional units.  The Pa and Pt test statistics pool
    information over all the cross-sectional units to test H0: a_i = 0 for
    all i vs H1:  a_i &lt; 0 for all i. Rejection of H0 should therefore be
    taken as evidence of cointegration for the panel as a whole.
<p>
    The tests are very flexible and allow for an almost completely
    heterogeneous specification of both the long- and short-run parts of the
    error correction model, where the latter can be determined from the data.
    The series are allowed to be of unequal length.
<p>
    If the cross sectional units are suspected to be correlated, robust
    critical values can be obtained through bootstrapping.

<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>lags(</b><i>#</i><b> [</b><i>#</i><b>])</b> If one number is specified, it determines a fixed number of
        lags p to be included in the error correction equations.  f two
        numbers are specified the Akaike information criterion is used to
        determine an optimal lag length pi for each separate time series,
        within the given limits.
<p>
    <b>leads(</b><i>#</i><b> [</b><i>#</i><b>])</b> Similar to the option lags it determines the number of leads
        to be included in the error correction equations.
<p>
    <b>lrwindow(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> Sets the width of the Bartlett kernel window used in the
        semi-parametric estimation of long run variances.
<p>
    <b>constant</b> When given, a constant is added to the cointegration
        relationship.
<p>
    <b>trend</b> Allows for a deterministic trend in the cointegration relationship.
<p>
    <b>bootstrap(#)</b> This option shows bootstrapped p-values for all four test
        statistics.  These are robust in the presence of common factors in
        the time series. The argument determines the number of bootstrap
        replications. On Stata/IC the number of replications must be smaller
        than 800.
<p>
    <b>westerlund</b> This option should be used only to replicate the tables in
        Westerlund (2007).
<p>
    <b>noisily</b> With this option xtwest shows the regressions for the separate
        series.  If a range of lags or leads is given, only the regression
        chosen by the AIC is shown.
<p>
    <b>mg</b> If specified, xtwest reports the mean group error-correction model,
        averaging coefficients of the error-correction equation over all
        cross-sectional units, together with the implied long-run
        relationship. This is much like the output of <b>xtpmg</b> with the "mg"
        option, but allowing for different lag and lead lengths in the
        different cross-sectional units.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    use http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/x/xtwestdata.dta
<p>
    In many applications at least a constant term is added to the
    cointegration equation
    xtwest loghex loggdp, constant lags(1 3) leads(0 3) lrwindow(3)
<p>
    Bootstrapping takes a long time unless the lead and lag lengths are fixed
    xtwest loghex loggdp, constant trend lags(1) leads(1) lrwindow(3)
        bootstrap(100)
<p>
    The westerlund option should only be used to replicate the results of
    Westerlund (2007)
    xtwest loghex loggdp, westerlund constant trend lags(1 3) leads(0 3)
        lrwindow(3)
    xtwest loghex loggdp, westerlund constant trend lags(1) leads(1)
        lrwindow(3) bootstrap(100)
