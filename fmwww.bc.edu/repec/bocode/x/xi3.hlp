Its syntax is much like the{cmd:xi} command.{p 8 14}{cmd:xi3} [{cmd:,} {cmdab:pre:fix(}{it:string}{cmd:)}] {it:term(s)}{p 8 14}{cmd:xi3} [{cmd:,} {cmdab:pre:fix(}{it:string}{cmd:)}] {cmd::}		{it:any_stata_command} {it:varlist_with_terms}  {it:...}{p}where a term is a mixture of continuous (Con) and categorical (Cat) variablesof the form:{col 9}Main Effects{col 9}Con{col 29}{it:varname}{col 9}Cat{col 29}{cmd:prefix.}{it:varname}{col 9}Two Way Interactions{col 9}Cat by Cat{col 29}{cmd:prefix.}{it:varname1}{cmd:*prefix.}{it:varname2}{col 9}Cat by Con{col 29}{cmd:prefix.}{it:varname1}{cmd:*}{it:varname2}{col 9}Con by Cat{col 29}{it:varname1}{cmd:*prefix.}{it:varname2}{col 9}Con by Con{col 29}{it:varname1}{cmd:*}{it:varname2}{col 9}Three Way Interactions{col 9}Cat by Cat by Cat{col 29}{cmd:prefix.}{it:varname1}{cmd:*prefix.}{it:varname2}{cmd:*prefix.}{it:varname3}{col 9}Cat by Cat by Con{col 29}{cmd:prefix.}{it:varname1}{cmd:*prefix.}{it:varname2}{cmd:*}{it:varname3}{col 12}...{col 9}Con by Con by Con{col 29}{it:varname1}{cmd:*}{it:varname2}{cmd:*}{it:varname3}{p}and you can also request simple effects for two way interactions using the {cmd:@} operator{p_end}{col 9}Cat by Cat{col 29}{cmd:prefix.}{it:varname1}{cmd:@prefix.}{it:varname2}{col 9}Con by Cat{col 29}{it:varname1}{cmd:@prefix.}{it:varname2}{p}{hi:Additional Coding Schemes}{p}The {cmd:xi3} command allows additional prefixes beyond {cmd:i.}{it:varname}.These prefixes create a number of additional coding schemes, as described below.{p}Please note: Starting with version 1.0 (April 7, 2003) the prefixes s, d, and f have been replaced with g, e, and a (respectively).  This now permits the s., d. and f. prefixes to be used as time series operators reflecting seasonal differences, backward differencing, andforward differencing (respectively).{p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:i.}varname - Indicator (dummy) coding: compares each level to the omitted group {p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:c.}varname - Centered indicator (dummy) coding {p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:g.}varname - reference Group coding: compares each level to a reference group {p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:e.}varname - Effect coding: deviations from the grand mean{p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:h.}varname - Helmert coding:         compares levels of a variable with the mean of subsequent levels{p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:r.}varname - Reverse Helmert coding: compares levels of a variable with the mean of previous levels{p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:a.}varname - Adjacent differences:          each level vs. the next level{p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:b.}varname - Backward adjacent differences: each level vs. the previous level {p_end}{p 5 17}{cmd:o.}varname - Orthogonal polynomial contrasts u.varname - User defined coding scheme{p_end}{p}{hi:Omitted Categories for Additional Coding Schemes}{p_end}{p}The {cmd:refgroup} command is included with {cmd:xi3} to allow you toselect the reference group (also called the omitted category).  This is simplya shorthand for using {inp:char {it:varname}[omit] {it:#}}.  The syntax of {cmd:refgroup}is{p_end}{col 9}{cmd:refgroup} {it:varname} {cmd:#}{p}The following describes how omitted categories are handled using eachcoding scheme.{p_end}{p 5 5}{hi:Indicator coding}.  The choice of the omitted category works just like the original {cmd:xi} program, i.e. the first category is omittedunless you use {inp:char {it:varname}[omit] {it:#}} or {inp:char _dta[omit] "prevalent"} (see {help xi:help xi} for more information).Note that {inp:char _dta[omit] "prevalent"} is ignored for all of the otherother coding schemes.{p_end}{p 5 5}{hi:Simple and Deviation coding}.  By default, the first category is the omittedcategory and you can use {inp:char {it:varname}[omit] {it:#}} to choose a different levelto be omitted.{p_end}{p 5 5}{hi:Helmert and Forward Difference coding}. For these coding schemesthe last category is always omitted (because the last category cannot be comparedto subsequent categories.{p_end}{p 5 5}{hi:Reverse Helmert and Backward Difference coding}. For these coding schemesthe first category is always omitted (because the first category cannot be comparedto prior categories.{p_end}{p 5 5}{hi:Orthogonal Polynomial coding}. The kth level is omitted.{p_end}{p 5 5}{hi:User Defined coding}.  The user defines {it:k-1} contrasts to betested, as described in the section Creating User Defined Coding below.{p_end}{p}{hi:Creating User Defined Coding}{p_end}{p}It may be easiest to describe user defined coding via an example.Say you have a variable {hi:ses} with 3 levels, and you wish to form 2 comparisons.The first will compare level 1 with levels 2 and 3, and the second will comparelevels 1 and 3.  The comparison coefficients for these two comparisons would be.{p 5 5}comparison 1: {inp:1 -.5 -.5}{p_end}{p 5 5}comparison 2: {inp:1   0  -1}{p_end}{p}You indicate these comparisions like this{p_end}{p 5 5}{inp:. char ses[user] (1 -.5 -.5 \ 1 0 -1)}{p_end}{p}{hi: Simple Comparisons and Simple Effects}{p}Say you wanted to specify {hi:deviation} contrasts on {hi:varname1} ateach level of {hi:varname2}, along with {hi:simple} contrasts on {hi:varname2}. You can use {cmd:@} like this to request that coding.{p_end}{p 5 5}{inp:d.varname1@s.varname2}{p_end}{p}For example to perform {hi:forward difference} conrasts on {hi:ses}at each level of {hi:female} and {hi:simple} coding on female, youcould type{p_end}{p 5 5}{inp:. xi3 f.ses@s.female}{p_end}{p}The terms that would be created are listed below along with theirinterpretation.  {hi:_Ises_1} {col 20}ses(1 vs. 2){hi:_Ises_2} {col 20}ses(2 vs. 3){hi:_Ifemale_1} {col 20}female(1 vs. 0){hi:_IsesWfem_1_1} {col 20}ses(1 vs. 2) @ female==0{hi:_IsesWfem_2_1} {col 20}ses(2 vs. 3) @ female==0{hi:_IsesWfem_1_2} {col 20}ses(1 vs. 2) @ female==1{hi:_IsesWfem_2_2} {col 20}ses(2 vs. 3) @ female==1{p}As you see, the lower order effects {hi:_Ises_1 _Ises_1} and {hi:_Ifemale_1}are created as though you had used an interaction.  But the terms{hi: _IsesWfem_1_1 _IsesWfem_2_1 _IsesWfem_1_2} and {hi:_IsesWfem_2_2} reflect simpleeffects of {hi:ses} at the levels of {hi:female}.  For example {hi: _IsesWfem_1_1}is the effect of low ses vs. middle ses for males, and {hi: _IsesWfem_1_2}is the effect of middle ses vs. high ses for males.{p_end}{p}If you wanted to form the simple effect of {hi:ses} for males, you would use the{cmd:test} command to test {hi:_IsesWfem_1_1} and {hi:_IsesWfem_1_2}, for example{p_end}{p 5 5}{inp:. test _IsesWfem_1_1 _IsesWfem_1_2}{p_end}{p}Note that when you use {cmd:xi3} to create the coding scheme, it createsboth the main effects for {hi:female} and for {hi:ses} and for the simplecontrasts of {hi:ses} at each level of {hi:female}.  However, if you include allof these terms in an estimation model, it will be overparameterized.  Instead, youwish to drop, in this example, the main effect of {hi:ses} since that effect is alsocontrained in the simple effects.  When you use {cmd:xi3} with a command, it automatically drops the {hi:ses} main effects, although those variables arecreated, see example below.{p 5 5}{inp:. xi3 : regress write f.ses@s.female}{p_end}{text}f.ses             _Ises_1-3           (naturally coded; _Ises_3 omitted)s.female          _Ifemale_0-1        (naturally coded; _Ifemale_0 omitted)f.ses@s.female    _IsesWfem_#_#       (simple effects of ses at female){result}      Source |       SS       df       MS              Number of obs =     200-------------+------------------------------           F(  5,   194) =    5.67       Model |  2278.24419     5  455.648837           Prob > F      =  0.0001    Residual |  15600.6308   194  80.4156228           R-squared     =  0.1274-------------+------------------------------           Adj R-squared =  0.1049       Total |   17878.875   199   89.843593           Root MSE      =  8.9675------------------------------------------------------------------------------       write |      Coef.
