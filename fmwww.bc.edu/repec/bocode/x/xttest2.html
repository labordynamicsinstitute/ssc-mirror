Breusch-Pagan LM test for cross-sectional correlation in fixed effects model
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^xttest2^ 
<p>
<p>
^xttest2^ is for use with cross-section time-series data, following use of 
^xtreg, fe^, ^xtgls^ or ^ivreg2^, and requiring prior use of ^tsset^.
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^xttest2^ calculates the Breusch-Pagan statistic for cross-sectional 
independence in the residuals of a fixed effect regression model, following 
Greene (2000, p. 601). ^xtreg, fe^ estimates this model assuming independence 
of the errors. A likely deviation from independent errors in the context of 
pooled cross-section time-series data (or panel data) is likely to be 
contemporaneous correlations across cross-sectional units. These correlations 
are those exploited by Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) 
estimator, and this test is provided by ^sureg, corr^ in that context.  
^xttest2^ tests the hypothesis that the residual correlation matrix, computed 
over observations common to all cross-sectional units, is an identity matrix 
of order N_g, where N_g is the number of cross-sectional units. The resulting 
test statistic is distributed Chi-squared(d), where d=N_g * (N_g - 1) /2, 
under the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence.
<p>
In the context of an unbalanced panel, the observations used to calculate 
the test statistic are those available for all cross-sectional units. The 
number of available observations is reported, as is the estimated correlation
matrix of the residuals over cross-sectional units.
<p>
Since this routine makes use of Stata's matrix language, it cannot compute
the test if the number of panels in the data exceeds the current matsize 
(^help matsize^). 
<p>
The test statistic, degrees of freedom and number of available observations 
are placed in the return array.
<p>
Note that this Breusch-Pagan test is not that commonly employed to test for
heteroskedasticity.
