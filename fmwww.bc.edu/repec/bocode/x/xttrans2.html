Description
-----------
<p>
If you have not read help for @xt@, please do so now.
<p>
^xttab^, a generalization of @tabulate@, performs one-way tabulations and decom
&gt; -
poses counts into between and within components in cross-sectional time-series
(xt) data. ^xttab^ is part of official Stata and untouched by the author. 
<p>
^xttrans2^, another generalization of @tabulate@, reports transition probabilit
&gt; ies
(the change in a single categorical variable over time). It differs from 
official Stata's ^xttrans^ only in detail: (a) options of ^tabulate^ other 
than ^row^ and ^freq^ also may be specified; (b) a matrix of probabilities may 
be saved; (c) it may not be called ^by^ varlist. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^i(^varname^)^ specifies the variable name corresponding to i; see help @xt@.
<p>
^t(^varname^)^ specifies the variable name corresponding to t; see help @xt@.
<p>
^freq^, allowed with ^xttrans2^ only, specifies that frequencies as well as tra
&gt; nsi-
    tion probabilities are to be displayed.
<p>
^prob^ specifies that the matrix produced contain probabilities rather than 
    frequencies. 
<p>
tabulate_options are options of ^tabulate^ other than ^row^ and ^freq^. For 
    example, it may be useful to use ^matcell^ to save the frequencies to 
    a matrix.
