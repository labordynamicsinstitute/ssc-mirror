    {it:exp} is a linear expression containing
        {it:coef}
        {it:eqno:coef}
        {cmd:_b[}{it:coef}{cmd:]}
        {cmd:_b[}{it:eqno}{cmd::}{it:coef}{cmd:]}
        {cmd:[}{it:eqno}{cmd:]}{it:coef}
        {cmd:[}{it:eqno}{cmd:]_b[}{it:coef}{cmd:]}

    {it:eqno} is
        {cmd:#}{it:#}
        {it:name}

{pstd}
{it:exp} is any linear combination of coefficients that is valid
syntax for {helpb lincom:lincom}. An optional {it:name} may be specified to label 
the transformation; {it:name} can be any {help reswords:valid Stata name}. 


{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:xlincom} computes point estimates, standard errors, t or z statistics,
p-values, and confidence intervals for single or multiple linear combinations of coefficients 
as well as covariances in the case of multiple combinations. {helpb nlcom:nlcom} can also do this, 
but {cmd:xlincom} is much faster and offers the same syntax as {helpb lincom:lincom}. {cmd:xlincom} 
internally calls {helpb lincom:lincom} for each linear combination and extracts coefficient 
estimates and variances from its output. Results can be posted or reposted for exporting 
with pretty table commands or testing.


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options} 

{phang}
{opt post} posts estimation results in {cmd:e()}.

{phang}
{opt repost} adds results to the estimates in memory. If the estimates in memory are from a 
single equation model, the model estimates will be prefixed with equation name "Main" and the linear combinations 
will be prefixed with equation name "xlincom". In the case of a multiple equation model, the linear combinations will 
be added with equation name "xlincom". This option is intended to make it easy to create tables combining
model coefficients and linear combinations of these coefficients.

{phang}
{opt covzero} sets covariances to zero for speed improvements. The 
transformations should not be tested against other coefficients 
if this option is specified as this will yield invalid results. 

{phang}
{opt level(#)} specifies the confidence level. The default is {cmd:level(95)} 
or as set by {helpb set level}.

{phang}
{opt df(#)} specifies that the t distribution with {it:#} degrees of
freedom be used for computing p-values and confidence intervals.
The default is to use {cmd:e(df_r)} degrees of freedom or the standard normal
distribution if {cmd:e(df_r)} is missing.

{phang}
{opt noheader} suppresses header output.

{phang}
{opt eform}, {opt or}, {opt hr}, {opt shr},  {opt irr}, and {opt rrr} all report
coefficient estimates as exp(b) rather than b. Only one of these options may be 
specified. {opt or} is the default after {cmd:logistic}. See {helpb lincom:help lincom} 
for more information about these options.

{title:Stored results}

{pstd}
{cmd:xlincom} stores the following in {cmd:r()}:

{synoptset 15 tabbed}{...}
{p2col 5 15 19 2: Scalars}{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:r(level)}}confidence level{p_end}

{synopt:{cmd:r(table)}}coefficient table{p_end}
{p2colreset}{...}

{pstd}
If option {opt post} is specified, {cmd:xlincom} stores the following in {cmd:e()}:

{synoptset 15 tabbed}{...}
{p2col 5 15 19 2: Scalars}{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:e(N)}}number of observations{p_end}

{pstd}
If option {opt repost} is specified, {cmd:xlincom} keeps the estimates in memory
but changes {cmd:e(b)} and {cmd:e(V)} to include coefficients and variance/covariances
of the linear combinations. 


{marker acknowledgments}{...}
{title:Acknowledgments}

{pstd} 
I would like to thank Roger Newson, as some of the code of {cmd:xlincom} 
is based on the code of his command {cmd:lincomest}. 

{pstd} 
I would also like to thank Ben Jann, who pointed me towards the approach to add
results to the estimates in memory which led to the {opt repost} option. 

{pstd}
Since much of {cmd:xlincom}'s options are the same as {cmd:lincom}'s I have 
used information from the help file of {helpb lincom:lincom} while making 
this help file for consistency and clarity, especially for shared options.
