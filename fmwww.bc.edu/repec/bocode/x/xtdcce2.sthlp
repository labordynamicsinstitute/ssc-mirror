{p 4 4}{cmd:xtdcce2} estimates a heterogeneous coefficient model in a dynamic panel with dependence between cross sectional units. 
It supports the Common Correlated Effects Estimator (CCE) by Pesaran (2006), the Dynamic Common Correlated Effects Estimator (DCCE), 
proposed by Chudik and Pesaran (2015) and the Mean Group Estimator (MG, Pesaran and Smith, 1995) and the Pooled Mean Group Estimator (PMG, Shin et. al 1999). 
Additionally, {cmd:xtdcce2} tests for cross sectional dependence (see {help xtcd2}) and supports instrumental variable estimations (see {help ivreg2}).{p_end}


{marker options}{title:Options}

{p 4 8}{cmdab:cr:osssectional}({varlist}) defines the variables which are added as cross sectional averages to the equation. 
Variables in {cmd:crosssectional()} may be included in {cmd:pooled()}, {cmd:exogenous_vars()}, {cmd:endogenous_vars()} and {cmd:lr()}. 
Default option is to include all variables from {depvar}, {indepvars} and {cmd:endogenous_vars()}. 
Variables in {cmd: crosssectional()} are partialled out, the coefficients not estimated and reported.{p_end}
{p 8 8}{cmd:crosssectional}(_all) adds all variables as cross sectional averages. 
No cross sectional averages are added if {cmd:crosssectional}(_none) is used, which is equivalent to {cmd:nocrosssectional}.
{cmd:crosssectional}() is a required option but can be substituted by {cmd:nocrosssectional}.{p_end}

{p 4 8}{cmdab:p:ooled}({varlist}) specifies variables which estimated coefficients are constrained to be equal across all cross sectional units.
Variables may occur in {indepvars}. 
Variables in {cmd:exogenous_vars()}, {cmd:endogenous_vars()} and {cmd:lr()} may be pooled as well.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmd:cr_lags}({it:string}) sets the number of lags of the cross sectional averages. If not defined but {cmd:crosssectional()} contains a varlist, then only contemporaneous cross sectional averages are added but no lags. {cmd:cr_lags(0)} is the equivalent.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmdab:nocross:sectional} suppresses adding any cross sectional averages
Results will be equivalent to the Mean Group estimator, or if {cmd:lr()} is set to the Pooled Mean Group estimator.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmdab:pooledc:onstant} restricts the constant term to be the same across all cross sectional units.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmdab:reportc:onstant} reports the constant term. If not specified the constant is partialled out.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmdab:noconst:ant} suppresses the constant term.{p_end}

{p 4 8}{cmd:xtdcce2} supports IV regressions using {help ivreg2}. 
The IV specific options are:{break}
	{cmdab:ivreg2:options}({it:string}) passes further options to {cmd:ivreg2}, see {help ivreg2##s_options:ivreg2, options}.{break}
	{cmd:e_ivreg2} posts all available results from {cmd:ivreg2} in {cmd: e()} with prefix {it:ivreg2_}, see {help ivreg2##s_macros: ivreg2, macros}.{break}
	{cmdab:noi:sily} displays output of {cmd:ivreg2}.{break}
	{cmd:ivslow}: For the calculation of standard errors for pooled coefficients an auxiliary regression is performed.
	In case of an IV regression, xtdcce2 runs a simple IV regression for the auxiliary regressions. 
	this is faster.
	If option is used {cmd:ivslow}, then xtdcce2 calls ivreg2 for the auxiliary regression. 
	This is advisable as soon as ivreg2 specific options are used.{p_end}

{p 4 8}{cmd:xtdcce2} is able to estimate pooled mean group models (Shin et. al 1999), similar to {help xtpmg}. {break}
	{cmd:lr}({varlist}) specifies the variables to be included in the long-run cointegration vector. The first variable is the error-correction speed of adjustment term.{break}
	{cmd:lr_options}({it:string}), options for the long run coefficients. Options are:{break}{break}{p_end}
	{col 12}{cmd:nodivide} coefficients are not divided by the error correction speed of adjustment vector. Equation (7) is estimated, see {help xtdcce2##pmg:xtdcce2, pmg options}.
	{col 12}{cmd:xtpmgnames} coefficient names in {cmd: e(b_p_mg)} (or {cmd: e(b_full)}) and {cmd: e(V_p_mg)} (or {cmd: e(V_full)}) match the name convention from {help xtpmg}.

{p 4 8 12}{cmd:trend} adds a linear unit specific trend. May not be combined with {cmd:pooledtrend}.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmdab:pooledt:rend} adds a linear common trend. May not be combined with {cmd:trend}.{p_end}

{p 4 8}Two methods for small sample time series bias correction are supported:{break}
	{cmdab:jack:knife} applies the jackknife bias correction method. May not be combined with {cmd:recursive}.{break}
	{cmdab:rec:ursive} applies the recursive mean adjustment method. May not be combined with {cmd:jackknife}.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmd: nocd} suppresses calculation of CD test. For details about the CD test see {help xtcd2}.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmdab:showi:ndividual} reports unit individual estimates in output.{p_end}

{p 4 8 12}{cmd:fullsample} uses entire sample available for calculation of cross sectional averages. 
Any observations which are lost due to lags will be included calculating the cross sectional averages (but are not included in the estimation itself).

{marker model}{title:Econometric and Empirical Model}

{p 2}{ul: Econometric Model}{p_end}

{p 4}Assume the following dynamic panel data model with heterogeneous coefficients:{p_end}

{col 10} (1) {col 20} y(i,t) = b0(i) + b1(i)*y(i,t-1) + x(i,t)*b2(i) + u(i,t)
{col 20} u(i,t) = g(i)*f(t) + e(i,t)

{p 4 4} where f(t) is an unobserved common factor loading, g(i) a heterogeneous factor loading, x(i,t) is a (1 x K) vector and b2(i) the coefficient vector.
The error e(i,t) is iid and the heterogeneous coefficients are randomly distributed around a common mean. It is assumed that x(i,t) is strictly exogenous.
In the case of a static panel model (b1(i) = 0) Pesaran (2006) shows that mean of the coefficients b1 and b2 (for example for b1 = 1/N sum(b1(i))) 
can be consistently estimated by adding cross sectional means of the dependent and all independent variables.
The cross sectional means approximate the unobserved factors. 
In a dynamic panel data model (b1(i) <> 0) pT lags of the cross sectional means are added to achieve consistency (Chudik and Pesaran 2015).
For both, the mean group estimates for b1 and b2 are consistently estimated as long as N,T and pT go to infinity. 
This implies that the number of cross sectional units and time periods is assumed to grow with the same rate. 
In an empirical setting this can be interpreted as N/T being constant. 
A dataset with one dimension being large in comparison to the other would lead to inconsistent estimates, even if both dimension are large in numbers. 
For example, a financial dataset on stock markets returns on a monthly basis over 30 years (T=360) of 10,000 firms would not be sufficient. 
While individually both dimension can be interpreted as large, they do not grow with the same rate and the ratio would not be constant. 
Therefore, an estimator relying on fixed T asymptotics and large N would be appropriate. 
On the other hand, a dataset with let's say N = 30 and T = 34 would qualify as appropriate, if N and T grow with the same rate (thanks to an anonymous referee for these examples).{p_end}

{p 2}{ul: Empirical Model}{p_end}

{p 4 4}The empirical model of equation (1) is:{p_end}

{col 10}(2){col 20} y(i,t) = b0(i) + b1(i)*y(i,t-1) + x(i,t)*b2(i) + sum[d(i)*z(i,s)] +  + e(i,t),

{p 4 4} where z(i,s) is a (1 x K+1) vector including the cross sectional means at time s and the sum is over s=t...t-pT.
{cmd:xtdcce2} supports several different specifications of equation (2).{p_end}

{p 2}{ul: i) Mean Group}{p_end}

{p 4 4} If no cross sectional averages are added (d(i) = 0), then the estimator is the Mean Group Estimator as proposed by Pesaran and Smith (1995).
The estimated equation is:

{col 10}(3){col 20} y(i,t) = b0(i) + b1(i)*y(i,t-1) + x(i,t)*b2(i) + e(i,t).

{p 4 4} Equation (3) can be estimated by using the {cmd:nocross} option of {cmd:xtdcce2}. The model can be either static (b(1) = 0) or dynamic (b(1) <> 0).{p_end} 

{p 2}{ul: ii) Common Correlated Effects}{p_end}

{p 4 4} The model in equation (3) does not account for unobserved common factors between units.
To do so, cross sectional averages are added in the fashion of Pesaran (2006):{p_end} 

{col 10}(4){col 20} y(i,t) = b0(i) + x(i,t)*b2(i) + d(i)*z(i,t) + e(i,t).

{p 4 4}  Equation (4) is the default equation of {cmd:xtdcce2}.
Including the dependent and independent variables in {cmd:crosssectional()} and setting {cmd:cr_lags(0)} leads to the same result.
{cmd:crosssectional()} defines the variables to be included in z(i,t).
Important to notice is, that b1(i) is set to zero. {p_end}

{p 2}{ul: iii) Dynamic Common Correlated Effects}{p_end}

{p 4 4} If a lag of the dependent variable is added, endogeneity occurs and adding solely contemporaneous cross sectional averages is not sufficient any longer to achieve consistency.
However Chudik and Pesaran (2015) show, that consistency is gained if pT lags of the cross sectional averages are added:{p_end}

{col 10}(5){col 20} y(i,t) = b0(i) + b1(i)*y(i,t-1) + x(i,t)*b2(i) + sum [d(i)*z(i,s)] + e(i,t).

{p 4 4} where s = t...t-pT. Equation (5) is estimated if the option {cmd:cr_lags()} contains a positive number.{p_end}

{p 2}{ul: iv) Pooled Estimators}{p_end} 

{p 4 4} Equations (3) - (5) can be constrained that the parameters are the same across units. Hence the equations become:{p_end}

{col 10}(3-p){col 20} y(i,t) = b0 + b1*y(i,t-1) + x(i,t)*b2 + e(i,t),
{col 10}(4-p){col 20} y(i,t) = b0 + x(i,t)*b2 + d(i)*z(i,t) + e(i,t),
{col 10}(5-p){col 20} y(i,t) = b0 + b1*y(i,t-1) + x(i,t)*b2 + sum [d(i)*z(i,s)] + e(i,t).


{p 4 4}Variables with pooled (homogenous) coefficients are specified using the {cmd:pooled({varlist})} option. 
The constant is pooled by using the option {cmd:pooledconstant}. 
In case of a pooled estimation, the standard errors are obtained from a mean group regression. 
This regression is performed in the background. See Pesaran (2006).{p_end}

{p 2}{ul: v) Instrumental Variables}{p_end}

{p 4 4}{cmd:xtdcce2} supports estimations of instrumental variables by using the {help ivreg2} package. 
Endogenous variables (to be instrumented) are defined in {varlist}2 and their instruments are defined in {varlist}_iv.{p_end}

{marker pmg}{p 2}{ul: vi) Pooled Mean Group Estimator}{p_end}

{p 4 4} As an intermediate between the mean group and a pooled estimation, Shin et. al (1999) differentiate between homogenous long run and heterogeneous short run effects.
Therefore the model includes mean group as well as pooled coefficients.
Equation (1) (for a better readability without the cross sectional averages) is transformed into an ARDL model:{p_end}

{col 10}(6){col 20}y(i,t) = phi(i)*(y(i,t-1) - x(i,t)*w(i)) + g0(i) + g1(i)*[y(i,t)-y(i,t-1)] + [x(i,t) - x(i,t-1)] * g2(i) + e(i,t),

{p 4 4}where phi(i) is the cointegration vector, w(i) captures the long run effects and g1(i) and g2(i) the short run effects.
Shin et. al estimate the long run coefficients by ML and the short run coefficients by OLS.
{cmd:xtdcce2} estimates a slighlty different version by OLS:{p_end}

{col 10}(7){col 20}y(i,t) = phi(i)*y(i,t-1) + x(i,t)*o1(i) + g0(i) + g1(i)*[y(i,t)-y(i,t-1)] + [x(i,t) - x(i,t-1)] * g2(i) + e(i,t),

{p 4 4}where w(i) = - o1(i) / phi(i). Equation (7) is estimated by including the levels of y and x as long run variables using the {cmd:lr({varlist})} and {cmd:pooled({varlist})} options and adding the first differences as independent variables.
{cmd:xtdcce2} estimates equation (7) but automatically calculates estimates for w(i).
The advantage estimating equation (7) by OLS is that it is possible to use IV regressions and add cross sectional averages to account for dependencies between units.

The dataset contains yearly observations from 1960 until 2007 and is already tsset.
To estimate a growth equation the following variables are used:

{p 4 4}{cmd:xtdcce2} internally estimates equation (7) and then recalculates the long run coefficients, such that estimation results for equation (8) are obtained.
Equation (7) can be estimated adding {cmd:nodivide} to {cmd:lr_options()}.
A second option is {cmd:xtpmgnames} in order to match the naming convention from {help xtpmg}.
