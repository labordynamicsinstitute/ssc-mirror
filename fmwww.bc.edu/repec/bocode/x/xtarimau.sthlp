{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:xtarimau} is a panel wrapper for {cmd:arimaauto} which is {it:de facto} an "augmented" Mata-written sister program to Christopher F. Baum's ARMA-limited
{helpb arimasel} with mutually consistent output, allowing for ARIMA({it:p,d,q})
and multiplicative seasonal ARIMA({it:p,d,q})({it:P,D,Q}) models, selecting the
best model based on the LLF, AIC or SIC, and returning its estimates at the same
time. However, unlike {helpb arimasel}, the selection is by default peformed
with the help of the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm, first implemented in the
{browse "https://www.rdocumentation.org/search?q=auto.arima":{bf:auto.arima}}
function (part of of the "forecast" package) in the {bf: R language}.

{pstd}
{cmd:xtarimau} can therefore be considered an {bf:estimation command}, built on
top of {helpb arimaauto}, storing estimates under the name {bf:ts_#} or saving
them into a .ster file and returning the best estimated models in
{bf:r(models)}. The user can also access {bf:r(ictests)}, {bf:r(icarima)}, and
{help return:hidden} {bf:r(limits)}.

{pstd}
{ul:Stata-adjusted Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm:}

{pstd}
The model selection algorithm described in Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) is
based on a combination of a modified Canova-Hansen seasonal unit root test
(with an empirical formula for calculation of its critical values) and of the
KPSS unit root test, aimed at avoiding (alleged) overdifferencing caused
by tests which assume unit root in their null hypothesis such as {helpb hegy}
and {helpb dfuller:[TS] dfuller}. Since the Canova-Hansen test was unavailable
in {bf:Stata 17} and its implementation would have been a feat of its own,
the algorithm was "inverted" to work with more powerful GLS-based
{helpb hegy} and {helpb dfgls:[TS] dfgls} unit root tests with a correction
by the KPSS unit root test to prevent the mentioned overdifferencing aka large
{it:#d} in ARIMA({it:p,d,q}) and ARIMA({it:p,d,q})({it:P,D,Q}) models. The
user can disable GLS in {helpb hegy} and pass additional options to all the
three tests; see {help arimaauto##syntax:{it:options (syntax)}}.

{pstd}
{ul:Unit root tests:}

{pstd}
{helpb hegy} performs the Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo (HEGY) (1990) test
for both monthly and quarterly data, allowing for generalized least-squares
(GLS) and ordinary least-squares (OLS) and detrending (controlled by the
{opt nog:ls} option). It automatically determines the lag length (order of
augmentation) based on the modified AIC (MAIC) (del Barrio Castro, Osborn, and
Taylor, 2016), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and sequential t test
for the last augmentation lag (Hall, 1994; Ng and Perron, 2001). User may
control the deterministic terms with help of the {cmd:det()} option; see
{helpb hegy} for syntax and examples. The critical values are constructed
from the empirically estimated response surface (del Barrio Castro,
Bodnar, and Sans{c o'}, 2015).

{pstd}
{bf:NB} {cmd:xtarimau} only uses the {helpb hegy}'s t test for Nyquist
frequencies (t_S/2).

{pstd}
{helpb dfgls:[TS] dfgls} performs a modified Dickey-Fuller t test for a unit
root in which the series has been transformed by a generalized least-squares
regression. By default, a trend is included; see {helpb dfgls:[TS] dfgls}
for syntax and examples.

{pstd}
{helpb kpss} performs the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, Shin (KPSS, 1992)
test for stationarity of a time series. This test differs from
{helpb dfgls:[TS] dfgls}, by having a null hypothesis of stationarity. The
test may be conducted under the null of either trend stationarity
(the default) or level stationarity; see {helpb kpss} for syntax and
examples.

{pstd}
{bf:PS} The maximum lag length in the unit root tests is calculated with the
help of the Schwert (1989) formula(s) (the default) or {cmd:xtarimau}'s
{opth maxl:ag(#)} option.
