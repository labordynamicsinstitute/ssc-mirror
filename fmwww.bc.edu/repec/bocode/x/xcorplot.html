Calculate and graph cross-correlation function
-----------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^xcorplot^ var1 var2 [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
        [^, l^ags^(^#^)^ { ^k^endall | ^p^earson | ^s^pearman }
        ^nop^rint ^sp^ike ^ci^ graph_options ]
<p>
Description
------------
<p>
^xcorplot^ calculates and graphs the first ^lags()^ cross-correlations of
var1 and var2, both positive and negative.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
--------
<p>
It is the user's responsibility to ensure that data are in appropriate
sort order (usually, but not necessarily, time order).
<p>
^xcorplot^ is built on Sean Becketti's ^xcorr^ and requires other
programs from his time series library to be installed.
<p>
<p>
Options
--------
<p>
^lags(^#^)^ specifies the number of lags.  If not specified, the first
    5 cross-correlations are graphed.
<p>
^kendall^ | ^pearson^ | ^spearman^ indicates which correlation coefficient
    to calculate.  The default is ^pearson^.
<p>
^noprint^ suppresses printing of the numeric results.
<p>
^spike^ causes the cross-correlations to be shown as a series of spikes
    drawn vertically from zero.
<p>
^ci^ adds approximate confidence interval bands to the graph at
    +/- 2 sqrt(number of data).
<p>
graph_options refers to any of the options of ^graph, twoway^.
<p>
<p>
Example
--------
<p>
 . ^xcorplot runoff rainfall^
<p>
<p>
Saved results
--------------
<p>
^xcorplot^ saves its results in the macros S_1, ... :
<p>
         ^S_1^          Correlation between var1 and var2
         ^S_2^          p-value of correlation between var1 and var2
         ^S_3^          Correlation between L.var1 and var2
         ^S_4^          p-value of correlation between L.var1 and var2
         ^S_5^          Correlation between var1 and L.var2
         ^S_6^          p-value of correlation between var1 and L.var2
