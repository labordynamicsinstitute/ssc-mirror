<b><u>Generalized linear models for age-period-cohort effects with hysteresis</u></b>
<p>
    Syntax
<p>
        <b>apch</b> <i>depvar</i> [<i>indepvars</i>] [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>] [<i>weight</i>] <b>, [</b> <b>age(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b>
              <b>period(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> <i>glm_options</i> ]
<p>
    <b>apch</b> allows all <i>varlists</i> &amp; <i>weights</i> that <b>glm</b> considers.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>apch</b> estimates age-period-cohort APC-D (detrended) models and provides
detrended (0 sum and 0 slope) parameters of age, period and cohort effects;
appropriate constraints offer a unique solution &amp; solve the traditional APC
identification problem.  We focus on cohort parameters (DCE=detrended cohort
effect) that should be tested to be non-zeros across cohort span.  Their
"hysteresis" (durability) over life course is assessed &amp; tested by a
coefficient h (hysteresis) that is 0 in case of linear stability of cohort
effect, -1 in case of vanishing of the cohort effect over life span, equal to 1
in case of development from 0 of the cohort effect over life course.  Since the
cohort parameters and the hysteresis parameter can not be assessed
simultaneously, the package proposes an iterative strategy that converges to a
single stable solution.  The <b>apch</b> provides Raftery's bics able to assess the
interest of cohort effect and then of hysteresis effect.
<p>
The user provides a dependant variable, age and period, and controls from a mic
&gt; rodata 
series of crossectional surveys. 
The data must be a complete rectangle (age x period) and the pace between perio
&gt; ds must 
be fix and equal to the distance between age groups. If not, the procedure will
&gt;  fail.  
<p>
The procedure delivers :
(1) An APC-Detrended model with controls, including zero-sum/zero-slope paramet
&gt; ers of 
        age, period &amp; cohort effects.
(2) An APC-Hysteresis model with controls, delivering the h-hysteresis paramete
&gt; r of 
        linear stability of the DCE. 
(3) Delta BICs are provided to measure 
        (a) dbic_cohort : the interest of including cohort effects after a AP m
&gt; odel and 
        (b) dbic_hyster : the interest of including hysteresis effects to the A
&gt; PC model 
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>age(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> and <b>period(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> specify the names of age and period variables.
    They must be given by the user.
<p>
Any <i>glm_options</i> can be valid options for <b>apch</b>.
<p>
Many types of model can be handled by <b>apch</b> :
<p>
* the user must call "family(bin) link(logit)" for a logit regression
<p>
* the user must call "family(poisson) link(log) exposure(pop)", where pop is
the population at risk, for a poisson model
<p>
* the default "family(gauss) link(id)" will provide a linear regression.
<p>

Since <b>apch</b> makes use of complex constraints, this package should be processed
on STATA 11.0 or higher.
