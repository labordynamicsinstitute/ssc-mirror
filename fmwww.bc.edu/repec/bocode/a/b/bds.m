The BDS statistic appears to%     be most efficient estimated if the measure of dimensional distance EPSILON is chosen%     such that the first-order correlation integral estimate (C1) lies around 0.7 (see%     Kanzler, 1998, forthcoming). For settings DISTANCE = 0.7 and FLAG = 1, the%     programme will chose EPSILON accordingly. Unfortunately, the cost of finding optimal%     EPSILON is quite high in terms of CPU time and required memory. For a near-normal%     distribution, the default settings achieve the same without any extra computational%     burden.% (3) The default setting is MAXRAM = 150, which is recommended for a system with 192MB%     physical RAM installed. The programme is highly optimised as to maximise speed given%     available memory, so it is very important to specify MAXRAM correctly as the amount%     of physical memory available AFTER starting MATLAB, loading any data and running%     other applications concurrently. The smaller the amount of RAM available to the%     programme (in relation to the length of SERIES), the slower the algorithm chosen%     from six alternatives. However, if MAXRAM is chosen too large, MATLAB will make use%     of virtual (hard-disk) memory, and this will slow down computation considerably.% (4) The default setting for MAXDIM is 2. For MAXDIM = 1, W and SIG are empty.% (5) A vector of NaN is returned if the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox is not installed.% (6) The BDS statistic W(M) is a function of C(M), C1(1), C1(M) and K, and these%     estimates are normally of no further interest.%% See Kanzler (1998) for some explanation of the main parts of the algorithm (other% explanations are commented into the below code), for a detailed investigation of the% finite-sample properties of the BDS statistic, for tables of small-sample quantiles and% for a comparison with software by Dechert (1988) and LeBaron (1988, 1990, 1997a, 1997b).% These and other important references can be found at the end of the script.%% * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *% * All rights reserved.

Hence the objective here is to choose EPSILON such that,% say, 70% of all observations lie within distance EPSILON to each other. If desired, the% programme first determines EPSILON as to fulfil this or a similar requirement.%% The conceptually simplest way of setting up the calculation of distance among all% observations is to define a two-dimensional table D (for "distance") of length and width% N and assign to each co-ordinate (x,y) the result of the problem ABS(x-y).%% In principle, the entire table could thus be created with the following one-line% statement:%             D = ABS( SERIES(ONES(1000,1),:)' - SERIES(ONES(1000,1),:) )%% Since the lower triangle of the table only replicates the upper triangle and since the% diagonal values represent own values (ones) which are not desired to be included in the% calculation, only the upper triangle receives further attention.%% Unfortunately, sewing all the row vectors of the upper triangle together to form one% single (row) vector makes indexing very messy. To aid understanding of the vector-space% indexing used here (as well as in the optional sub-function further below), one may wish% to refer to the following exemplary matrix table (N=7):%%                                       Using this example, it is easy to verify%          * * * *c o l u m n* * * *    that column vector I is defined by the%     I    1   2   3   4   5   6   7    following indices in vector space:%                                          I+(0 : I-2)*N - CUMSUM(1 : I-1)%  *  1    *   1   2   3   4   5   6%  *  2    .   *   7   8   9  10  11    More generally, column vector I starting only%  r  3    .   .   *  12  13  14  15    in row J is:%  o  4    .   .   .   *  16  17  18       I+(J-1 : I-2)*N - SUM(1:J-1)-CUMSUM(J : I-1)%  w  5    .   .   .   .   *  19  20%  *  6    .   .   .   .   .   *  21    Row vector I is given by indices:%  *  7    .   .   .   .   .   .   *       1+(I-1)*(N-1)-SUM(1:I-2) : I*(N-1)-SUM(1:I-1)%% (A formal derivation of the above formulae is beyond the scope of this script.)%% To calculate a percentile of the distribution of distance values, the row vector is% sorted (unfortunately, this requires a lot of time and RAM in MATLAB).if ~flag   demeaned = series-sum(series)/n;                        % fastest algorithm for   epsilon  = distance * sqrt(demeaned*demeaned'/(n-1));   % computing the standard   clear demeaned % to save memory                         % deviation of SERIES   elseif 0.000008 * 3 * sum(1:n-1) < maxram % check memory requirements for DIST and sorting   dist(1:sum(1:n-1)) = 0;   for i = 1 : n-1      dist(1+(i-1)*(n-1)-sum(0:i-2):i*(n-1)-sum(1:i-1)) = abs(series(i+1:n)-series(i));   end   sorted  = sort(dist);   epsilon = sorted(round(distance*sum(1:n-1))); % DISTANCEth percentile of SORTED series   clear dist sortedelse   error('Insufficient RAM to compute EPSILON; allocate more memory or use METHOD = 1.')end%%%%%%%%%%%% Computation and storage of one-dimensional distance information %%%%%%%%%%%%% Similarly to the above, a two-dimensional table C (for "close") of length and width N% can be defined by assigning to each co-ordinate (x,y) the result of the problem% ABS(x-y) <= EPSILON; (x,y) assumes the value 1 if the statement is true and 0 otherwise.%% Formally, for given EPSILON:%                                 C(x,y) = 1 if ABS(x-y) <= EPSILON%                                        = 0 otherwise%% Once again, the resulting information needs to be stored in the most efficient way.% In this implementation, this is done by chopping each row of the table into "words" of% several bits, the precise number of bits per word being determined by the above% algorithms. One "word" is thus represented by one integer. This slashes the size of the% table by the number of bits. See Kanzler (1998) for more details.%% The below routine stores all rows of the upper triangle of the conceptual table% (described in Kanzler, 1998) left-aligned and assigns zeros to all other elements.%% As will also be explained further below, the computation of parameter K requires the sum% of each FULL row, i.e. each row including the elements in the lower triangle and on the% diagonal. The "missing" bits correspond to the sums over each column in the upper% triangle, and these sums are also computed and stored in the below loop. And to make% matters simple, diagonal values are allocated to the column sums by initialising them% with value 1.

But this works only% if sufficient memory is available (methods 1, 3 and 5). Otherwise, the BITAND-operation% has to be performed by looping BACKWARDS through the table, taking as many rows as% possible at once (methods 2, 4 and 6).%% The number of bits set in rows M to N-1 (inclusive) is counted either in one go or% through the above loop by looking up the number of bits set for each integer (LeBaron,% 1997, uses a similar method), or, if memory was insufficient to create the required% BITINFO array, by column-wise brute-force counting.%% MATLAB uses logarithms to compute powers, and this can result in minute deficiencies in% accuracy. To avoid this, integer powers are computed by separate functions in this% script (see further below).
