    <b>bcii</b> -- Calculates the number needed to treat (NNT) and confidence
            intervals for patients improving (comparison between intervention
            and control group in a randomised controlled trial)
    <b>bcib</b> -- Calculates NNT and confidence intervals for patients benefiting
            (either improvements gained or deteriorations prevented) in a
            randomised controlled trial

<b><u>Descriptions</u></b>
<p>
    <b>bcii</b> estimates absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat for for
    the difference between the proportion of improving patients in the
    intervention group and the proportion of improving patients in the
    control group. It uses a method that is considered to have superior
    coverage properties to the conventional Wald method for calculating
    confidence intervals (Newcombe's Method 10); this may be important when
    reciprocally transforming absolute risk reductions to obtain numbers
    needed to treat (NNTs) as described by Bender, 2001.  estimates NNTs for
    benefit; the difference between the proportion of improving patients
    minus the proportion of deteriorating patients in the intervention group
    and the proportion of improving patients minus the proportion of
    deteriorating patients in the control group. Newcombe's method 10 has
    been modified to incorporate these extra variance terms as described by
    Froud et al, 2009.

    <b>level</b> set confidence level; it must lie between 0.1 and 99.9%, inclusive;
        default is the Stata level setting.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>bcii</b> calculates confidence intervals for the NNT by reciprocal
    transformation of risk difference confidence intervals, from differences
    between two independent proportions (patients improving in the treatment
    group and in the control group)using Newcombe's Method 10. The confidence
    intervals are considered to have better coverage than the conventional
    Wald confidence interval and are less prone to aberrations following
    reciprocal transformation to NNT limits.
<p>
    The sequence of <i>#a</i>, <i>#b</i>, <i>#c</i> and <i>#d</i> in <b>bcii</b> come from a contingency table
    of 'improvements' x group (see epitab). The additional <i>#a</i>, <i>#b</i>, <i>#c</i> and <i>#d</i>
    in <b>bcib</b> come from a similar table of 'deteriorations' (see epitab).
