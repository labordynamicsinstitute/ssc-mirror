Apply Benford's Law to a variable
---------------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^benford^     varname [if] [in] 
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^benford^ reads in the values of a variable and returns a 4 column table:
Column 1 contains the digits 1 through 9, column 2 contains the total number 
of values in the variable starting with that digit, Column 3 contains the 
percentage Column 2 represents and Column 4 is what benfords law expects.
So the closer Columns 3 and 4 are the more your numbers conform to Benfords 
law. 
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^benford^ just presents the measurements in a form which makes it easy to inspe
&gt; ct.
Both knowing whether your variable should conform to Benford's law or not and w
&gt; hether
the results suggest your dataset is authentic or rigged is up to you. The autho
&gt; r is happy 
to point the user to N. J. Cox's ^firstdigit^ module for a more comprehensive t
&gt; reatment
as well as acknowledge a masterful rewrite of the first - a more pedestrian - v
&gt; ersion.

Examples
--------
While developing I played with auto.dta which is both too small and contains no
&gt;  
variables which should conform to Benford's law. So to just see it work you can
&gt;  do:
<p>
<p>
 . ^sysuse auto.dta^
 . ^benford price^
<p>
<p>
The dataset http://www.stata-press.com/data/r9/census6.dta contains variables w
&gt; hich 
are suitable for Benford's Law. Although it is too small to get any reliable 
distribution it still shows a relative conformity.

 . ^  use http://www.stata-press.com/data/r9/census6.dta^
 . ^  benford pop^
<p>
will return:
