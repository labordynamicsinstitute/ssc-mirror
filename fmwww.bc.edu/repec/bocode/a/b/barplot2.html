Bar plot, with optional error bars
-----------------------------------
<p>
    ^barplot2^ yvar xvar [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    [ ^, w^idth^(^string^) b^ase^(^string^) e^rror^(^errorvar^)^
    graph_options ]
<p>
Description
------------
<p>
^barplot2^ produces a bar plot of yvar against xvar. yvar is plotted as
a series of unshaded bars rising above or falling below a base line.
The height of each bar is given by yvar, the width via the width option,
the base via the base option and the horizontal centre of each bar by
xvar.
<p>
Through the ^width()^ option, ^barplot2^ could be used to produce
overlapping or underlapping bars, if desired for some reason.
<p>
Through the ^error()^ option, error bars may be added to each bar.
<p>
<p>
Options
--------
<p>
^width(^string^)^ specifies how the widths of the bars are determined.
    ^width(^widthvar^)^ specifies that they are given by widthvar.
    ^width(^#^)^ specifies that they are constant and equal to #.
    The default is ^width(1)^.
<p>
^base(^string^)^ specifies how the bases of the bars are determined.
    ^base(^basevar^)^ specifies that they are given by basevar.
    ^base(^#^)^ specifies that they are constant and equal to #.
    The default is ^base(0)^.
<p>
^error(^errorvar^)^ specifies an variable containing errors. Error bars
    will be drawn as capped vertical lines connecting yvar +/- errorvar.
<p>
graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^, other than
    ^symbol^ and ^connect^, and ^xlabel^ by itself. Note that these
    options do not include ^shading^.
