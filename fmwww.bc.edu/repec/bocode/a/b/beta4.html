Fitting beta distribution by moments and maximum likelihood
-----------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^beta4^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [, ^s(^#^)^ ^t^ol^(^#^) sec^ ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^beta4^ works on a single variable. All non-missing values must be
between 0 and 1. A two-parameter beta distribution is fitted by the
method of moments (a closed-form calculation) and by the method of
maximum likelihood (ML) (an iterative calculation, which may
occasionally be rather slow). The parameters are shape parameters, here
called alpha and beta.
<p>
The algorithm used for ML estimation was proposed by P.W. Mielke (1975).
Mielke uses a parameterisation in terms of a location parameter
<p>
    p = alpha / (alpha + beta)
<p>
and a scale parameter
<p>
    gamma = alpha + beta
<p>
and moments and ML estimates of these are recorded in macros S_6-S_9.
<p>
Note: this is the original version of ^beta^, written for Stata 4. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^betafit^. 
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^s(^#^)^ controls the number of terms used within ^beta4^ in a series
    approximation. The default is 25. This is a technical option and
    should not normally be changed. See Mielke (1975) for enlightenment.
<p>
^tol(^#^)^ controls the tolerance used within ^beta4^ to control
    iteration. The default is 0.0000001. This is a technical option and
    should not normally be changed. See Mielke (1975) for enlightenment.
<p>
^sec^ produces estimates of the standard errors of alpha and beta and
    the correlation between alpha and beta.
