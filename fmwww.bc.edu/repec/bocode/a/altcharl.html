<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>altcharl</b> -- Charlson Score &amp; Comorbidities
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Version</u></b>
<p>
    Version 3.0.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  ICDPIC Version 3.0 has
    been tested in STATA 10 and STATA 11, but the authors believe it should
    also work without incident in STATA 8 and STATA 9.  If you have any
    problems using ICDPIC Version 3.0 in STATA 8 or STATA 9, please inform
    the authors.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 may be installed from within STATA using the <b>ssc</b>
    command.  If you installed a previous version of ICDPIC from the SSC
    archives website using the <b>ssc</b> command, we suggest that you first delete
    it by typing <b>ssc uninstall icdpic</b> followed by <b>ssc install icdpic</b>.
    Alternatively, you may use <b>ssc install icdpic, replace</b>.  See help for 
    ssc.
<p>
    If you installed any previous ICDPIC files obtained directly from the
    authors, please delete them <b>ALL</b> (.ado, .hlp and .dta files) to avoid any
    conflicts with ICDPIC 3.0 files.
<p>
    Please enter complete variable names in the ICDPIC Version 3.0 dialog
    boxes.  Do not use abbreviations.
<p>
    New to Version 3.0 is the addition of a dialog box (.dlg) file associated
    with each individual ICDPIC Version 3.0 program (.ado) file.  To access
    the ICDPIC dialog box, and all the ICDPIC programs, type: <b>db icdpic</b>.
    Typing <b>icdpic</b>, as in earlier versions, will still work, but <b>ONLY</b> with
    <b>icdpic</b>.  For example, to access the Charlson Score\Comorbidities
    (Alternate Version) program directly, type: <b>db altcharl</b>.  Typing
    <b>altcharl</b>, as in previous versions, will produce an error.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to use path\file names
    containing spaces.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to run in STATA 11.0.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is a bug that caused the <b>triss</b> program to
    crash if the <i>rts</i> variable was named anything other than "rts".
<p>
    New in ICDPIC Version 3.0 (<b>trauma</b> program only) is the ability to choose
    whether an AIS value of 6 automatically forces an ISS of 75 or to
    automatically have all AIS values of 6 changed to an AIS value of 5 and
    then have the ISS calculated normally.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have memory.  Each time a dialog
    box is opened within the same STATA session, it will remember the values
    last entered.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have the following buttons:
<p>
      <i>OK</i> executes the program and removes the dialog box from the screen.
<p>
      <i>SUBMIT</i> executes the program and leaves the dialog box on the screen.
             Note that if an error message is generated the dialog box may be
             minimized.
<p>
      <i>CANCEL</i> removes the dialog box from the screen and does nothing.
             Clicking on the close icon of the dialog box does the same
             thing.
<p>
      <i>HELP</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and presents the program help
           file.  The <i>HELP</i> button has a question mark on it.
<p>
      <i>COPY</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and copies the program command
           to the clipboard.
<p>
      <i>RESET</i> resets the values of the controls in the dialog box to their
            initial state, just as if the dialog box were invoked for the
            first time.  Each time a user invokes a dialog box, its controls
            will be filled in with the values the user last entered.  <i>RESET</i>
            restores the control values to their defaults.  The <i>RESET</i> button
            has an R on it.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>altcharl</b> determines which Charlson comorbidities are present, the number
    of Charlson comorbidities present and the Charlson score.
<p>
<p>
      CHARLSON SCORE = the sum of the weights of each comorbidity present
<p>
<p>
    If mild liver disease and moderate to severe liver disease are both
    present, only the presence of moderate to severe liver disease is used in
    calculating the Charlson score.  If both mild to moderate diabetes
    mellitus and diabetes mellitus, chronic complications, are both present,
    only the presence of diabetes mellitus, chronic complications, is used in
    calculating the Charlson score.  If any malignancy and metastatic solid
    tumor are both present, only the presence of metastatic solid tumor is
    used in calculating the Charlson score.  The above also pertains in
    determining which comorbidities are present and calculating the number of
    comorbidities.  For example, if both mild and moderate to severe liver
    disease are present only the moderate to severe liver disease variable
    indicates the presence of a comorbidity and is counted in determining
    both the number of comorbidities and the Charlson score.
<p>
    Comorbidity diagnostic categories are included if, and only if, they
    include ICD-9-CM codes identified by Romano et al, with an asterisk under
    the column "Dartmouth-Manitoba codes" in Table 1 of that study.  Within
    these included categories, only diagnosis or procedure codes with
    asterisks are used.  Exceptions are Rheumatologic Disease and AIDS
    categories, which were too rare to be included in the original study but
    have been included in our version.
<p>
    A complete list of all categories, diagnosis codes and procedure codes
    used to calculate our version of the Charlson Score is given below.

    *NOTE1: Diagnosis and procedure code reference tables have been updated
            to reflect new codes within the above specified ranges.  No
            attempt has been made to identify and include individual codes
            that may be applicable.
<p>
    **NOTE2: Diagnosis codes 43.X and 44.X are no longer valid and are not
             included in the diagnosis code reference table.  Procedure code
             62.4 seems to have always been a sub category rather than an
             actual procedure code but has been left in as it will not cause
             any harm.

    For a more standardized treatment of the Charlson comorbidity index, with
    options that include ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM and enhanced ICD-9-CM versions,
    the user is encouraged to type "findit charlson" from within STATA
    without the quotation marks.  STATA will locate this module on the
    Internet.  Just follow the instructions given to download it.
<p>
    See also the <b>Options</b> and <b>Remarks</b> sections for <b>IMPORTANT</b> information on,
    and requirements for, <b>altcharl</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procdure codes in the user's data may, or may not,
    contain a decimal point.  Simply choose the option that applies to your
    data in the <i>Charlson Score &amp; Comorbidities (Alt. Ver.)</i> dialog box.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>altcharl</b> adds the following Boolean variables (0 if absent, 1 if present)
    to a new copy of the user's data stored on disk:
<p>
<p>
        <i>mi</i>: myocardial infarction
        <i>pvd</i>: peripheral vascular disease
        <i>dementia</i>: dementia
        <i>copd</i>: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
        <i>rheum</i>: rheumotologic disease
        <i>mld</i>: mild liver disease
        <i>sld</i>: moderate to severe liver disease
        <i>mdm</i>: moderate diabetes mellitus
        <i>ccdm</i>: chronic complications of diabetes mellitus
        <i>renal</i>: renal disease
        <i>any_mal</i>: any malignancy
        <i>mst</i>: metastatic solid tumor
        <i>aids</i>: AIDS
<p>
<p>
    <b>altcharl</b> also adds the following variables to a new copy of the user's
    data stored on disk:
<p>
<p>
        <i>charlcnt</i>: the total number of comorbidities present
        <i>charlval</i>: the Charlson score
<p>
<p>
    The user's data must contain both ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and ICD-9-CM
    procedure codes.  ICD-9-CM codes in the user's data must be of type
    string.  A decimal point in the ICD-9-CM codes is optional.  Diagnosis
    codes should have a width of 5 (6 if a decimal point is present) and
    procedure codes should have a with of 4 (5 if a decimal point is
    present).  The diagnosis code prefix must be the same for all diagnosis
    codes and numbered sequentially starting with 1, for example, dx1...dxN.
    The same holds true for procedure codes, for example, px1...pxN.
<p>
    <b>altcharl</b> requires the use of lookup tables <b>cdtab_s1.dta</b>, <b>cdtab_s2.dta</b>,
    <b>cptab_s1.dta</b> and <b>cptab_2.dta</b>.  These data tables are supplied.  _s1
    tables are for use with data without the decimal point in ICD-9-CM codes
    and _s2 tables are for data that include the decimal point.  See help for
    icdpic, specifically the LOOKUP TABLES part of the <b>Remarks</b> section.
