d 'ABRS': module to provide Toolkit for counterfactuals based on a spatial equilibrium framework with heterogenous preferences by Ahlfeldt, Bald, Roth, Seidel: â€œMeasuring quality of life under spatial frictions"    
d
d  This toolkit allows for counterfactual evaluations of the
d effects of changes in labor productivity, quality of life, or
d housing productivity on employment, wage, and housing rent in a
d spatial general equilibrium framework with heterogeneous worker
d preferences. We use a toy version of the Quantitative Spatial
d Model in Ahlfeldt, Bald, Roth, Seidel (WIP). To establish the
d general equilibrium, the model clears the labor, housing, and
d goods market. For didactic purposes, we generate a graph that
d illustrates all combinations between the following endogenous
d variables that satisfy all equilibrium conditions: wage vs.
d employment, employment vs. rent, rent vs. wage. The rectangles in
d the graphs generated by the program represent the only
d combinations of employment, wage, and rent that satisfy all
d equilibrium conditions of the model.	This toolkit allows for
