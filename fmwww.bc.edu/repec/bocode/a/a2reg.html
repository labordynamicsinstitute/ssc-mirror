<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>a2reg</b> estimates two-way fixed effects.  <i>individual</i> indexes the first fixed
effect, and <i>unit</i> indexes the second fixed effect. The dependent variable is
<i>depvar</i> and the covariates are in <i>indepvars</i>. At least one covariate is
mandatory.
<p>
<b><u>Identification constraints</u></b>
<p>
The identification constraints for the fixed effects are set by convention such
that the sum of individual effects is equal to zero and such that the last unit
fixed effect is zero.
<p>
<b><u>Output</u></b>
<p>
The program displays conventional output regression, along with Fisher tests
for the significance of fixed effects. However the computation of confidence
intervals is not computationally feasible, since it would require the inversion
of the variance-covariance matrix. Therefore confidence intervals are not
printed.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<i>depvar</i> is the dependent variable. No missing observation is allowed.
<p>
<i>indepvars</i> lists explanatory variables. No missing observation is allowed.
<p>
<b>individual(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is the identifier for the first fixed effect.
<p>
<b>unit(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is the identifier for the second fixed effect.
<p>
<b>indeffect(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> is the name of the output variable for the first fixed effect. 
<p>
<b>uniteffect(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> is the name of the output variable for the second fixed effect
&gt; .
<p>
<b>xb(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> is the name of the output variable for the part predicted by the covar
&gt; iates.
<p>
<b>resid(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is the name of the output variable for the resid.
<p>

<b><u>Examples</u></b>

This command started as a port of the FORTRAN cg program that was written by
<b>Robert Creecy</b> for Unix platforms. It has now improved it in many ways,
providing Fisher tests, interfacing with STATA and commands such as bootstrap.
