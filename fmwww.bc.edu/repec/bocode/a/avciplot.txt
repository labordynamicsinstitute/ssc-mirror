TITLE
      'AVCIPLOT': produces added-variable plots with confidence intervals

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
      
		-avciplot- produces added-variable plots after -regress- 
		estimations to show the partial correlation of one 
		regressor with the outcome variable, controlling for all 
		the other regressors. This is similar to the Stata -avplot- 
		command, but adds confidence intervals and other options.
		
		-avciplots- produces a combined graph of added-variable 
		plots from all the regressors in the previous regression.
