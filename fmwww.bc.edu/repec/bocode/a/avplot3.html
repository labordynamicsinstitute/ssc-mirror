<b><u>Partial regression plots for subsamples </u></b>

        <b>avplot3</b> <i>varname</i> <b>,</b><b><u>sep</u></b><b>arate(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> [ <i>graph_options</i> ]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>avplot3</b> generates "partial regression plots" from an analysis of covariance
model, where a category variable has been included in dummy-variable form among
the regressors along with a constant term (that is, a dummy for all but one
categories appears) and the full set of dummies have been interacted with a
continuous variable. The "partial predictions" of such a model are then
defined, for each category, as the category-specific constant term plus the
category-specific slope multiplied by the continuous variable. Any number of
additional covariates, continuous or discrete, may appear in the regression
model, but do not affect the partial predictions.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
One variable must be specified: the continuous variable which has been fully
interacted in the regression model. If there are G categories of the discrete
variable, the continuous variable must be included as G interaction terms, each
named <i>categoryvarname</i> x <i>varname</i>.  See the example below.
<p>
The separate option must specify the integer variable (<i>categoryvarname</i>) that
defines the G categories. The model must contain (G-1) dummy variables for all
but one category, and a constant term. It is immaterial which category is
excluded.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<i>graph_options</i> are options of <b>graph, twoway</b>. One may use, for instance, the
    saving option to create a .gph file from the displayed graph.
<p>
    The defaults include <b>connect(l)</b> for each subset of predicted values.
<p>
<b>separate(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies the integer variable which defines categories.
