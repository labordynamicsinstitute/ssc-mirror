Description
- -----------
<p>
^addtxt^ adds ^text^ to the most recent graph, positioned at graph
coordinates (^x,y^).
<p>
This program translates graph coordinates into screen coordinates, and is
otherwise a wrapper for the -@gph@ text- command.  It is based on the addtext
program printed in the manual [G] gph, p.64; but includes additional syntax
options which are passed to -@gph@- commands.
<p>
<p>
Options
- -------
<p>
^align(^#^)^: -1, 0, or 1 for left, center and right-justified.  Default is
    left-justified.   see [G] gph text options
<p>
^rotate(^#^)^: 0 or 1.  0 = text is placed horizontally from left to right
                        (default).
                    1 = text is placed vertically from bottom to top.
<p>
^fhgt(^%^)^ font height.  Argument should be integer percentage of default font
    height if other than default is desired.  See [G] gph font.
<p>
^fwdth(^%^)^ font width.  Argument should be integer percentage of default font
    width if other than default is desired.  See [G] gph font.
<p>
^pen(^#^)^ sets the current pen, where # is 0-9. default is 1 (recommended for
    text).  See [G] gph pen.
<p>
<p>
Comments
- --------
<p>
^addtxt^ will not work if the current graph was displayed via
- -graph using &lt;filename&gt;- or was generated by a program or do-file which
utilized local macros for variable name arguments (eg. -sts graph-).
