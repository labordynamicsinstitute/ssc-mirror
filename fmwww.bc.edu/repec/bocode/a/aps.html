<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>aps</b> -- Anatomic Profile Score
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Version</u></b>
<p>
    Version 3.0.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  ICDPIC Version 3.0 has
    been tested in STATA 10 and STATA 11, but the authors believe it should
    also work without incident in STATA 8 and STATA 9.  If you have any
    problems using ICDPIC Version 3.0 in STATA 8 or STATA 9, please inform
    the authors.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 may be installed from within STATA using the <b>ssc</b>
    command.  If you installed a previous version of ICDPIC from the SSC
    archives website using the <b>ssc</b> command, we suggest that you first delete
    it by typing <b>ssc uninstall icdpic</b> followed by <b>ssc install icdpic</b>.
    Alternatively, you may use <b>ssc install icdpic, replace</b>.  See help for 
    ssc.
<p>
    If you installed any previous ICDPIC files obtained directly from the
    authors, please delete them <b>ALL</b> (.ado, .hlp and .dta files) to avoid any
    conflicts with ICDPIC 3.0 files.
<p>
    Please enter complete variable names in the ICDPIC Version 3.0 dialog
    boxes.  Do not use abbreviations.
<p>
    New to Version 3.0 is the addition of a dialog box (.dlg) file associated
    with each individual ICDPIC Version 3.0 program (.ado) file.  To access
    the ICDPIC dialog box, and all the ICDPIC programs, type: <b>db icdpic</b>.
    Typing <b>icdpic</b>, as in earlier versions, will still work, but <b>ONLY</b> with
    <b>icdpic</b>.  For example, to access the Anatomic Profile Score program
    directly, type: <b>db aps</b>.  Typing <b>aps</b>, as in previous versions, will
    produce an error.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to use path\file names
    containing spaces.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to run in STATA 11.0.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is a bug that caused the <b>triss</b> program to
    crash if the <i>rts</i> variable was named anything other than "rts".
<p>
    New in ICDPIC Version 3.0 (<b>trauma</b> program only) is the ability to choose
    whether an AIS value of 6 automatically forces an ISS of 75 or to
    automatically have all AIS values of 6 changed to an AIS value of 5 and
    then have the ISS calculated normally.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have memory.  Each time a dialog
    box is opened within the same STATA session, it will remember the values
    last entered.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have the following buttons:
<p>
      <i>OK</i> executes the program and removes the dialog box from the screen.
<p>
      <i>SUBMIT</i> executes the program and leaves the dialog box on the screen.
             Note that if an error message is generated the dialog box may be
             minimized.
<p>
      <i>CANCEL</i> removes the dialog box from the screen and does nothing.
             Clicking on the close icon of the dialog box does the same
             thing.
<p>
      <i>HELP</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and presents the program help
           file.  The <i>HELP</i> button has a question mark on it.
<p>
      <i>COPY</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and copies the program command
           to the clipboard.
<p>
      <i>RESET</i> resets the values of the controls in the dialog box to their
            initial state, just as if the dialog box were invoked for the
            first time.  Each time a user invokes a dialog box, its controls
            will be filled in with the values the user last entered.  <i>RESET</i>
            restores the control values to their defaults.  The <i>RESET</i> button
            has an R on it.

<p>
    The <i>ICDPIC</i> dialog box will open.  Choose <i>Anatomic Profile Score</i> and click
    <i>OK</i> or <i>Submit</i>.  The <i>APS (Anatomic Profile Score)</i> dialog box will open.
    Follow the instructions.

<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>aps</b> calculates the anatomic profile score.  The anatomic profile score
    (APS) is computed from three modified components from three different
    body region groups: The mA component represents head/brain and spinal
    cord injures; the mB component represents thorax and neck injuries and;
    the mC component represents all other serious injuries.  The modified
    components are defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of
    all serious injuries (AIS = 3, 4, 5 or 6) within their specified body
    region groups.  Once the modified components are determined,
<p>
<p>
          APS = 0.3199(mA) + 0.4381(mB) + 0.1406(mC) + 0.7961(maxAIS)
<p>
<p>
    maxAIS is the maximum severity of all a patients injuries.
<p>
    See also the <b>Remarks</b> section for <b>IMPORTANT</b> information on, and
    requirements for, <b>aps</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    None
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    The user should first run <b>trauma</b> or <b>icdpic</b> on his/her data to add
    anatomic profile (AP) component variables, severity variables and the
    maxAIS variable.  See help for trauma for descriptions and names of these
    variables.
<p>
<p>
    <b>aps</b> adds the following variables to a new copy of the user's data stored
    on disk:
<p>
<p>
        <i>aps</i>: anatomic profile score
        <i>mA</i>: the sum of the squares of the severities of all serious injuries
            with AP component category A
        <i>mB</i>: the sum of the squares of the severities of all serious injuries
            with AP component category B
        <i>mC</i>: the sum of the squares of the severities of all serious injuries
            with AP component category C
<p>
<p>
    Variables <i>mA</i>, <i>mB</i>, <i>mC</i> and <i>aps</i> are rounded to the nearest 0.0001.
<p>
    Anatomical profile scores include AIS values of 6.  Thus, it is possible
    to have an injury severity score of 75 and differing values of the
    anatomical profile score.  Also, it is possible to have an anatomical
    profile score when there are no serious injuries because of the term
    0.7961(maxAIS) in the equation.
<p>
    Also note:
<p>
    1) If maxAIS is 9, variables <i>mA</i>, <i>mB</i>, <i>mC</i>, and <i>aps</i> all are assigned
        99.9999.
    2) If maxAIS is any number 1 thru 6, variables <i>mA</i>, <i>mB</i>, and <i>mC</i> are
        assigned the sum of the squares of the severities with those AP
        components respectively.  The anatomical profile score is computed
        per the equation given under the <b>Description</b> section.  If there are
        no injuries with a particular AP component value, then a value of 0
        is assigned.
    3) If maxAIS is 0, variables <i>mA</i>, <i>mB</i>, and <i>mC</i> all have the value 0 and <i>aps</i>
        has the value 0.0000.
