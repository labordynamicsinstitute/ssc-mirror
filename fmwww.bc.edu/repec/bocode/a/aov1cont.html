Contrasts in one-way ANOVA from means, SD's and N's
---------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^aov1cont^ nvar meanvar sdvar [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]^,^
        ^c^oeffs^(^coeffvar^)^|^tr^end [ ^le^vel^(^#^)^ ]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^aov1cont^ calculates the contrast (L) for coefficients in coeffvar over the
means in meanvar.  The group sizes are in nvar and the SDs are in sdvar.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^coeffs(^coeffvar^)^|^trend^: one of these is REQUIRED. If ^trend^ is specified
&gt; ,
L is a standardized linear trend contrast using integers with spacing 1.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ defines the confidence interval coverage for L. Default: $S_level.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
Like @contrast@, ^aov1cont^ calculates the standardized contrast L as
<p>
        L = (a1 * mean1) + (a2 * mean2) + (a3 * mean3) + ...
<p>
where mean1 is the first value of meanvar and a1 is the first STANDARDIZED
coefficient in coeffvar, and so on.  ^aov1cont^ always standardizes the coeff-
icients so that they add up to zero; it does so by subtracting the mean of
coeffvar from each of its values.  The standardized coefficients (a1, a2, etc)
are labelled ^__a^ in the output from ^aov1cont^.  The output includes a
confidence interval for L and a significance test for L = 0.

 . ^aov1cont n mean sd, coeffs(c)^
 . ^aov1cont n mean sd, trend^

Stored
------
<p>
        ^$S_1^  total number of observations in analysis of variance
        ^$S_2^  number of groups in analysis of variance
        ^$S_3^  value of standardized contrast, L
        ^$S_4^  standard error of L
        ^$S_5^  lower confidence limit for L
        ^$S_6^  upper confidence limit for L
        ^$S_7^  t value for test of L = 0
        ^$S_8^  P value for test of L = 0
