<b><u>Creates mobility groups for the identification of two-way fixed effects</u></b>
<p>
        <b>a2group</b> , [ <b>individual(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> <b>unit(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> <b>groupvar(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>a2group</b> creates a new variable <i>groupvar</i> containing the mobility group which the
individual and the unit belong to. Within these mobility groups, two-way fixed
effects can be estimated, with <i>individual</i> indexing the first fixed effect, and
<i>unit</i> indexing the second fixed effect.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>individual(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is the identifier for the first fixed effect.
Typically, <i>varname</i> will be an person's ID, such as an employee ID. 
<p>
<b>unit(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is the identifier for the second fixed effect.
Typically, <i>varname</i> will be a unit ID, such as a firm ID. 
<p>
<b>groupvar(</b><i>groupvar</i><b>)</b> is the name of the new variable containing
the identifier of the mobility group.

<b><u>Examples</u></b>

This command started as a port of the FORTRAN cg program that was written by
<b>Robert Creecy</b> for Unix platforms. It has now improved it in many ways,
providing Fisher tests, interfacing with STATA and commands such as bootstrap.
