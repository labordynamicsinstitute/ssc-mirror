<b><u>Edit an ado-file in Stata's do-file editor</u></b>
<p>
        <b>adoedit</b> <i>cmdname</i>
        
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>adoedit</b> attempts to edit whichever ado-file named <b>cmdname.ado</b> is first on
    the current adopath.  If you are using an old version of Stata, you may
    not be able to edit files larger than 32,000 bytes in the do-file editor.
    Built-in commands cannot edited no matter what.  This routine is designed
    for use by those who are writing their own ado-files; users are exhorted
    to make a copy of any official ado-files, and to save modified official
    ado-files in the ado directory, rather than the Stata directory.
<p>
    <b>adoedit cmdname.ado</b> is tolerated.
<p>
    After a successful edit, the <b>discard</b> command is issued so that Stata will
    load the revised ado-file. This will also clear any estimates from the
    last estimation.
<p>
    If you wish to edit ado-files with a different text editor, please see
    fedit and the texteditors modules on the SSC archive.

    setup to open ".ado" file types if the file is too big to open in Stata's
    do-file editor.
