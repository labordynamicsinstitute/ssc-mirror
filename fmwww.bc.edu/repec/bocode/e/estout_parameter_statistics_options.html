<pre>
    <b>cells(</b><i>array</i><b>)</b> specifies the parameter statistics to be reported and how
        they are to be arranged. The default is for cells to report raw
        coefficients only, i.e. <b>cells(b)</b>. <b>cells(none)</b> may be used to
        completely suppress the printing of parameter statistics.
        Alternatively, <b>cells(b se)</b> would result in the reporting of raw
        coefficients and standard errors. Multiple statistics are placed in
        separate rows beneath one another by default. However, elements of
        <i>array</i> that are listed in quotes, e.g. <b>cells("b se")</b>, are placed
        beside one another. For example, <b>cells("b p" se)</b> would produce a
        table with raw coefficients and standard errors beneath one another
        in the first column and p-values in the top row of the second column
        for each model.
<p>
        The parameter statistics available are <b>b</b> (coefficients), <b>se</b> (standard
        errors), <b>t</b> (t/z-statistics), <b>p</b> (p-values), and <b>ci</b> (confidence
        intervals; to display the lower and upper bounds in separate cells
        use <b>ci_l</b> and <b>ci_u</b>). Any additional parameter statistics included in
        the <b>e()</b>-returns for the models can be tabulated as well. If, for
        example, <b>e(beta)</b> contains the standardized coefficients, type
        <b>cells(beta)</b> to tabulate them (see help estadd). Also see the <b>eform</b>
        and <b>margin</b> options for more information on the kinds of statistics
        that can be displayed.
<p>
        A set of suboptions may be specified in parentheses for each
        statistic named in <i>array</i>. For example, to add significance stars to
        the coefficients and place the standard errors in parentheses,
        specify <b>cells(b(star) se(par))</b>. The following suboptions are
        available. Use:
<p>
            <b>star</b> to specify that stars denoting the significance of the
                coefficients be attached to the statistic: <b>*</b> for p&lt;.05, <b>**</b>
                for p&lt;.01, and <b>***</b> for p&lt;.001. The symbols and the values for
                the thresholds and the number of levels are fully
                customizable (see the <i>significance_stars_options</i>).
<p>
            <b>fmt(%</b><i>fmt</i> [<b>%</b><i>fmt</i> ...]<b>)</b> to specify the display format(s) of a
                statistic. It defaults to the display format for raw
                coefficients (<b>b</b>), or <b>%9.0g</b>. If only one format is specified,
                it is used for all occurrences of the statistic. If multiple
                formats are specified, the first format is used for the first
                regressor in the estimates table, the second format for the
                second regressor, and so on. The last format is used for the
                remaining regressors if the number of regressors in the table
                is greater than the number of specified formats. Note that,
                regardless of the display format chosen, leading and trailing
                blanks are removed from the numbers. White space can be added
                by specifying a <b>modelwidth()</b> (see the <i>layout_options</i>).
<p>
            <b>label(</b>&lt;<i>string</i>&gt;<b>)</b> to specify a label to appear in the column
                heading. The default is the name of the statistic.
<p>
            <b>par</b>[<b>(</b>&lt;<i>left</i>&gt; &lt;<i>right</i>&gt;<b>)</b>] to specify that the statistic in question
                be placed in parentheses. It is also possible to specify
                custom "parentheses". For example, <b>se(par({ }))</b> would display
                the standard errors in curly brackets. For <b>ci</b> the syntax is:
<p>
                    <b>ci(par</b>[<b>(</b>&lt;<i>left</i>&gt; &lt;<i>middle</i>&gt; &lt;<i>right</i>&gt;<b>)</b>]<b>)</b>
<p>
            <b>drop(</b><i>droplist</i><b>)</b> to cause certain individual statistics to be
                dropped. For example, specifying <b>t(drop(_cons))</b> suppresses
                the t-statistics for the constants. A <i>droplist</i> comprises one
                or more specifications, separated by white space. A
                specification can be either a variable name (e.g. <b>price</b>), an
                equation name followed by a colon (e.g. <b>mean:</b>), or a full
                name (e.g. <b>mean:price</b>). Be sure to refer to the matched
                equation names, and not to the original equation names in the
                models, when using the <b>equations()</b> option to match equations.
<p>
            <b>keep(</b><i>keeplist</i><b>)</b> to cause certain individual statistics to be kept.
                For example, the specification <b>t(keep(mpg))</b> would display the
                t-statistics exclusively for the variable <b>mpg</b>. See the <b>drop()</b>
                suboption above for further details.
<p>
            <b>pattern(</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b> to designate a pattern of models for which the
                statistics are to be reported, where the <i>pattern</i> consists of
                zeros and ones. A <b>1</b> indicates that the statistic be printed;
                <b>0</b> indicates that it be suppressed. For example <b>beta(pattern(1</b>
                <b>0 1))</b> would result in <b>beta</b> being reported for the first and
                third models, but not for the second.
<p>
            <b>abs</b> to specify that absolute t-statistics be used instead of
                regular t-statistics (relevant only if used with <b>t()</b>).
<p>
    <b>drop(</b><i>droplist</i><b>)</b> identifies the coefficients to be dropped from the table.
        This option is passed to the internal call of <b>estimates table</b>.  See
        help estimates for details.
<p>
    <b>keep(</b><i>keeplist</i><b>)</b> selects the coefficients to be included in the table. The
        <b>keep()</b> option may also be used to change the order of the
        coefficients and equations within the table. This option is passed to
        the internal call of <b>estimates table</b>. See help estimates for details.
<p>
    <b>equations(</b><i>eqmatchlist</i><b>)</b> specifies how the models' equations are to be
        matched. This option is passed to the internal call of <b>estimates</b>
        <b>table</b>. See help estimates on how to specify this option.
<p>
    <b>eform</b>[<b>(</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b>] displays the coefficient table in exponentiated form.
        The exponent of <b>b</b> is displayed in lieu of the untransformed
        coefficient; standard errors and confidence intervals are transformed
        as well. Specify a <i>pattern</i> if the exponentiation is to be applied
        only for certain models. For instance, <b>eform(1 0 1)</b> would transform
        the statistics for Models 1 and 3, but not for Model 2. Note that,
        unlike <b>regress</b> and <b>estimates table</b>, <b>estout</b> in eform-mode does not
        suppress the display of the intercept. To drop the intercept in
        eform-mode, specify <b>drop(_cons)</b>.
<p>
    <b>margin</b>[<b>(</b>{<b>u</b>|<b>c</b>|<b>p</b>}<b>)</b>] indicates that the marginal effects or elasticities be
        reported instead of the raw coefficients. This option has an effect
        only if <b>mfx</b> has been applied to a model before its results were
        stored (see help mfx) or if a <b>dprobit</b> (see help probit),
        <b>truncreg,marginal</b> (help truncreg), or <b>dtobit</b> (Cong 2000) model is
        estimated. One of the parameters <b>u</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>p</b>, corresponding to the
        unconditional, conditional, and probability marginal effects,
        respectively, is required for <b>dtobit</b>. Note that the standard errors,
        confidence intervals, t-statistics, and p-values are transformed as
        well.
<p>
        Using the <b>margin</b> option with multiple-equation models can be tricky.
        The marginal effects of variables that are used in several equations
        are printed repeatedly for each equation because the equations per se
        are meaningless for <b>mfx</b>. To display the effects for certain equations
        only, specify the <b>meqs()</b> option. Alternatively, use the <b>keep()</b> and
        <b>drop()</b> options to eliminate redundant rows. The <b>equations()</b> option
        might also be of help here.
<p>
    <b>discrete(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> may be used to override the default symbol and
        explanatory text used to identify dummy variables when reporting
        marginal effects. The first token in <i>string</i> is used as the symbol.
        The default is:
<p>
            <b>discrete(" (d)" marginals for discrete change of dummy variable</b>
            <b>from 0 to 1)</b>
<p>
        To display explanatory text, specify either the <b>legend</b> option or use
        the <b>@discrete</b> variable.
<p>
        Use <b>nodiscrete</b> to disable the identification of dummy variables as
        such. The default is to indicate the dummy variables unless they have
        been interpreted as continuous variables in all of the models for
        which results are reported (for <b>dprobit</b> and <b>dtobit</b>, however, dummy
        variables will always be listed as discrete variables unless
        <b>nodiscrete</b> is specified).
<p>
    <b>meqs(</b><i>eq_list</i><b>)</b> specifies that marginals be printed only for the equations
        in <i>eq_list</i>. Specifying this option does not affect how the marginals
        are calculated.  An <i>eq_list</i> comprises one or more equation names
        (without colons) separated by white space. If you use the <b>equations()</b>
        option to match equations, be sure to refer to the matched equation
        names and not to the original equation names in the models.
<p>
    <b>level(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> assigns the confidence level, in percent, for the confidence
