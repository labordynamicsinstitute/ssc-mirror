{cmd:effdisp} {hline 2} creates plots of an interaction effect showing how the effect of a designated focal variable changes with its moderator(s). 

{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:effdisp} produces line plots, drop line plots, error bar plots or contour plots displaying the focal variable's effect on the observed or
 "modeled" outcome as it varies with the values of its moderator(s). Line plots and contour plots can optionally show where the moderated effect 
 of the focal variable is and is not significant. Must run {help intspec} before running {cmd:effdisp}. See Kaufman (2018) for detailed 
 explanation and step-by-step examples of using this and other ICALC add-on commands.

For a model predicting poor mental health days ({it:pmhdays}) by the interaction of work-family conflict ({it:wfconflict}) 
and job status ({it:sei}), {cmd:intspec} specfies {it:wfconflict} as the focal variable and {it:sei} as its moderator.  {cmd:effdisp} 
produces a confidence bounds plot of {it:wfconflict}'s effect on {it:pmhdays} as it changes with {it:sei}, the default plot type.

nbreg pmhdays c.wfconflict##c.sei ... {p_end}
{p 6 10 2}

After a model predicting voluntary association memberships ({it:memnum}) which includes the interaction of age, educ (education) and female, 
{cmd:intspec} specfies {it:female} as the focal, {it:age} as the 1st moderator and {it:educ} as the 2nd moderator. {cmd:effdisp} 
produces a confidence bounds plot of {it:female}'s effect on {it:memnum} as it changes with {it:age}, with a separate plot for each 
of the five display values for education (0,5,10,15,20).

{p 6 8 2}
reg memnum i.female##c.age##c.educ ... {p_end}
{p 6 8 2}
intspec, focal(i.female) main( (c.age, name(Age) range(18(10)88)) (c.educ, name(Education) range(0(5)20)) (i.female, name(Sex) range(0/1)) )
