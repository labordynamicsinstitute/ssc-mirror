Description
-----------
<p>
^electind^ computes electoral indicators: proportionality, fragmentation
(electoral and parliamentary), polarization and volatility between elections.
Both ^if^ and ^in^ are allowed, although ^by^ is not supported. It can be used 
&gt; with
either aggregate or individual voting data. ^varname^ identifies response
variable for individual data and count variable for aggregate data. In this
case, you must use ^party(^varname^)^ to identify party labels.
<p>
Options
-----------
<p>
^party(^varname^)^ identifies the variable containing party labels. It should
  be used only when response variable is a frequency variable containing number
  of votes at the aggregate level.
<p>
^district(^varlist^)^ identifies districts. It is required when there are more
  than one district.  Typically, &lt;varlist&gt; will contain only one variable
  identifying districts, but you can use up to five variables to nest districts
  within higher levels of aggregation, such as regions. I you are using
  ^save(^filename^)^, the new variables in &lt;filename&gt; will be named as distl1,
  distl2, ... from the highest level of aggregation to the lowest. For the
  sake of clarity, it is recommended to introduce the variables in &lt;varlist&gt; 
  according to this agreggation ordering, since variables in &lt;filename&gt; will
  appear in the same order. If you use this option, the program will compute
  indicators at the district and aggregate level.
<p>
^seats(^varname^)^ this option can be used to tell the program the number of se
&gt; ats
  by party. If used, the program will compute proportionality and parliamentary
  fragmentation.
<p>
^polar(^varlist^)^ identifies variables to compute polarization among groups,
  such as polarization by ideology. Up to five variables are allowed. If you
  use more than one variable, polarization will be computed using averaged
  polarization over the whole set of variables. Absolute and Euclidean
  measures of polarization are reported.
<p>
^time(^varname^)^ tells the program that the data contains more than one electi
&gt; on.
  This option identifies the date of the election or the order in which
  elections take place. Using this option means that the program will compute
  electoral and parliamentary volatitlity between elections.
<p>
^blocks(^varname^)^ tells the program that parties are grouped into blocks to
  compute inter and intra blocks volatility. You can only use it if you set
  ^time(^varname^)^ previously. If you are using ^time(^varname^)^, but do not
  set ^blocks(^varname^)^, all the parties are suppossed to belong to the same
  block. Then, inter-blocks volatility will be equal to 0, and intra-blocks
  volatility will be equal to total volatility.
<p>
^store^ causes the program to store any computed indicator (at the aggregate an
&gt; d
  the district level, if present) in current dataset using new variables. If
  variables are already defined an error message will be issued.
<p>
^nooutput^ tells the program to produce no output.
<p>
^nototal^ means that indicators will be calculated only at district level. This
  option is only available if you set ^district(^varlist^)^.
<p>
^save(^filename^)^ allows to store results in &lt;filename&gt;.
