    <b>stats(</b><i>scalarlist</i>[<b>,</b> <i>stats_subopts</i>]<b>)</b> specifies one or more scalar
        statistics - separated by white space - to be displayed at the bottom
        of the table. The <i>scalarlist</i> may contain <b>e()</b> scalars and the
        following statistics:
<p>
            <b>aic</b>     Akaike's information criterion
            <b>bic</b>     Schwarz's information criterion
            <b>rank</b>    rank of <b>e(V)</b>, i.e. the number of free parameters in model
            <b>p</b>       the p-value of the model (overall model significance)
<p>
        See help estimates for details on the <b>aic</b> and <b>bic</b> statistics.  The
        rules for the determination of <b>p</b> are as follows (note that although
        the procedure outlined below is appropriate for most models, there
        might be some models for which it is not):
<p>
            1) p-value provided: If the <b>e(p)</b> scalar is provided by the
               estimation command, it will be interpreted as indicating the
               p-value of the model.
<p>
            2) F test: If <b>e(p)</b> is not provided, <b>estout</b> checks for the
               presence of the <b>e(df_m)</b>, <b>e(df_r)</b>, and <b>e(F)</b> scalars and, if
               they are present, the p-value of the model will be calculated
               as <b>Ftail(df_m,df_r,F)</b>. This p-value corresponds to the
               standard overall F test of linear regression.
<p>
            3) chi2 test: Otherwise, if neither <b>e(p)</b> nor <b>e(F)</b> is provided,
               <b>estout</b> checks for the presence of <b>e(df_m)</b> and <b>e(chi2)</b> and, if
               they are present, calculates the p-value as
               <b>chi2tail(df_m,chi2)</b>. This p-value corresponds to the
               Likelihood-Ratio or Wald chi2 test.
<p>
            4) If neither <b>e(p)</b>, <b>e(F)</b>, nor <b>e(chi2)</b> is available, no p-value
               will be reported.
<p>
        The following <i>stats_subopts</i> are available. Use:
<p>
            <b>fmt(</b><i>fmtlist</i><b>)</b> to set the display formats for the scalar statistics
                in <i>scalarlist</i>. For instance, <b>fmt(%9.3f %9.0f)</b> would be a good
                choice for <b>stats(r2_a N)</b>. See help format. The last format in
                <i>fmtlist</i> is used for the remaining scalars if <i>scalarlist</i> has
                more elements than <i>fmtlist</i> does. Thus, only one format need
                be specified if all scalars are to be displayed in the same
                format. If no format is specified, the default format is the
                display format of the coefficients.
<p>
            <b>labels(</b><i>str_list</i>[<b>,</b> <i>label_subopts</i>]<b>)</b> to specify labels for the
                scalars in <i>scalarlist</i>. If specified, the labels are used
                instead of the scalar names. For example:
<p>
                    <b>. estout ..., stats(r2_a N, labels("Adj. R-Square"</b>
                    <b>"Number of Cases"))</b>
<p>
            <b>star</b>[<b>(</b><i>star_scalarlist</i><b>)</b>] to specify that the overall significance
                of the model be denoted by stars. The stars are attached to
                the scalar statistics specified in <i>star_scalarlist</i>. If
                <i>star_scalarlist</i> is omitted, the stars are attached to the
                first reported scalar statistic. The printing of the stars is
                suppressed in empty results cells (i.e. if the scalar
                statistic in question is missing for a certain model). The
                determination of the model significance is based on the
                p-value of the model (see above).
<p>
                Hint: It is possible to attach the stars to different scalar
                statistics within the same table. For example, specify
                <b>stats(,star(r2_a r2_p))</b> when tabulating OLS estimates and,
                say, probit estimates. For the OLS models, the F test will be
                carried out and the significance stars will be attached to
                the <b>r2_a</b>; for the probit models, the chi2 test will be used
