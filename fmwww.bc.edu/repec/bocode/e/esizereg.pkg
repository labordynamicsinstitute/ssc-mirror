d 'ESIZEREG': module  for computing the effect size based on a linear regression coefficient
d
d  esizereg is a postestimation command that calculates Cohen's d
d (Cohen 1988) and Hedges's g (Hedges 1981) effect size for both
d the unadjusted and adjusted mean difference of a continuous
d variable between two groups. esizereg uses the unstandardized
d regression coefficient of the treatment variable as the numerator
d (which is equivalent to the difference between two covariate
d unadjusted or adjusted means) and uses the pooled within-sample
d estimate of the population standard deviation (estimated with
d margins) as the denominator. Estimation models currently
d supported by esizereg are regress, tobit, truncreg, hetregress,
d xtreg, intreg, meintreg and metobit. When a weight is specified
d in the estimation model, esizereg produces a weighted effect size
d estimate. esizeregi is the immediate form of esizereg; see immed. d
