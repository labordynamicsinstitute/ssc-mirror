Description
-----------
<p>
^eba^ Performs an Extreme Bound Analysis on the regressor "var2",
        for given a dependent variable "var1", and a set of regressors 
        Z and X. Where Z(nxk) and X(nxm) with k&lt;=4.
        The program runs n!/(k!(n-k)!) OLS regressions by
        taking combinations of k&lt;=4 Z variables among the p listed. It then
        displays minimum and maximum parameter estimates for "var2" together 
        with their t-statistics, p-value and Z variables used. This version
        controls for multicollinearity through -vif.ado- already coming
        with stata.

Options
-------
<p>
^x(^varlist^)^ contains other possible regressors, common to all regressions.
        If it is not specified, it is assumed to be empty.
<p>
^type(^#^)^ tells the program how many Z variables should be taken for each
        combination (maximum 4). If it is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ tells the program within what confidence level the minimum and
        maximum for "ebavar" should be reported. If it is not specified, 
        it is assumed to be 0.95.
<p>
^vif(^#^)^ controls for the collinearity problem. It sets the maximum
        admissible VIF below which extremes have to be found. If it is not
        specified, the maximum is by default very high: i.e. it allows for 
        a high collinearity in the auxiliary regressions.
        N.B.    VIF is calculated for each of the n!/(k!(n-k)!) regressions
                and it slows down the program considerably. Hope to solve this
                sometime.
<p>
^ci(^#^)^ modyfies the confidence for the intervals of both the minimum and 
        maximum for "ebavar". If it is not specified, it is assumed to be .95.
<p>
^detail^ displays parameter estimate, t-statistics, p-value, maximum VIF
        and relative Z  variables for all regressions performed.
