<b><u>Plot coefficients or loadings after principal component or factor analysis</u></b>

<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>eofplot</b> plots coefficients or loadings of principal components or factors
    after pca or factor in sequence in relation to all the variables used in
    the analysis. It is thus a profile or parallel coordinates plot of the
    matrix e(L) (or e(r_L) when that exists).
<p>
    <b>eofplot</b> will by default plot rotated loadings when they can be found.
    That default can be overridden.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    There appears to be no standard name for this plot. The name loadingplot
    is already taken by Stata for a different though related plot. The name
    <b>eofplot</b>, although arbitrary, will at least suggest to some users the name
    empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) widely used in meteorology and
    oceanography within one flavour of principal component analysis (PCA).
<p>
    This plot is most natural and helpful when variables can be placed in a
    sequence (e.g. in terms of time or space) or grouped in terms of meaning.
    Conversely, the order of variables on the <i>x</i> axis is exactly that of the
    variables fed to the earlier <b>pca</b> or <b>factor</b> command, so that on occasion
    reissuing the original command with variables in a different order may
    allow a tidier plot to be produced afterwards.
<p>
    Use of this graph within the literature appears intriguingly capricious.
    Thus, of the leading monographs on principal component analysis, Jackson
    (1991) includes no examples, but Jolliffe (2002) includes several.
    Ramsey and Schafer (2002, pp.519-521) give a very nice example, which was
    the original stimulus for this program. See also literature on PCA
    applications in meteorology and oceanography such as von Storch and
    Zwiers (1999) or Wilks (2006).

<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
 
    <b>components()</b> specifies which components are to be plotted. By default,
        all components are plotted. That may lead to an untidy graph.  Thus a
        numlist may be specified with this option to select particular
        components to be plotted. For example, <b>components(1/3)</b> selects the
        first three components.
<p>
    <b>factors()</b> specifies which factors are to be plotted. By default, all
        factors are plotted. That may lead to an untidy graph.  Thus a 
        numlist may be specified with this option to select particular
        factors to be plotted. For example, <b>factors(1/3)</b> selects the first
        three factors.
<p>
        Note: Both options are given as a convenience. It is expected that
        users of <b>pca</b> will find the <b>components()</b> option naturally named, as
        will users of <b>factor</b> with the <b>factor()</b> option. However, there is no
        obligation to use the "correct" terminology.
<p>
    <b>number</b> specifies that the various components or factors are to be
        distinguished on the plot by marker labels with the appropriate
        numbers.  Thus components or factors 1, 2 and 3 would be
        distinguished by text with those numerals.  This option carries with
        it the other options <b>ms(i ..) mlabpos(0 ..) legend(off)</b>, but those
        options may in turn be overridden.  Although not the default, this
        option is recommended for a graph that is most nearly clean and
        self-explanatory.  See also marker label options.
<p>
    <b>norotated</b> uses unrotated results, even when rotated results are
        available.  The default is to use rotated results if they are
        available.  <b>norotated</b> is ignored if rotated results are not
        available.
<p>
    <i>twoway_connect_options</i> are options of twoway connect.  The defaults
        include (given the number of variables included in the principal
        component analysis or factor analysis <i>#variables</i>) <b>ytitle("loadings")</b>
        <b>xtitle(" ") xla(1/</b><i>#variables</i><b>, valuelabels) clw(thin ..)</b>.  If rotated
        loadings are shown, a <b>note()</b> indicates the rotation used. See title
        options. Note that the <i>x</i> axis runs from 1 to <i>#variables</i>.
