{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:eurostatuse} imports data from the Eurostat repository into Stata. It also provides information on the data set, downloads labels, separates flags and values, implements the reshape to long format, and fixes time formats.
{p_end}

{pstd}{it:table_name} should include just one Eurostat data file. You should only specify the Eurostat code, no extension, as indicated between brackets after the titles in the navigation tree. Capitalisation does not matter.
{p_end}

{p_end}

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}
{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opt long} creates output in the long format (time in rows). Default is wide. Depending on the size of the data set the reshaping could take a while.
{p_end}


{phang}
{opt [no]label} removes the label variable. This is the faster option and it keeps the file size small.
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt [no]flags} removes the flags (referring to comments) Eurostat adds to the data.
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt uncompressed} downloads the uncompressed .tsv file. Downloads will be larger and slower, but you don't need to install 7-zip on Windows and avoid using a shell command. This may help when using a working directory on a cloud drive.
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt save} saves output in a Stata data (.dta) file. The filename will be the table code in lower case.
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt clear} clears data memory before proceeding.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Select data}

{phang} These options significantly reduce processing time of long data requests. {p_end}

{phang}
{opt start()} defines the start period (e.g. yearly: 2008, half-yearly: 2009S2, quarterly: 2010Q3, monthly: 2011M04). It is somewhat lenient with respect to the time code.
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt end()} defines the end period (as above). You do not have to specify both end and start period (or any).
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt geo()} selects data by {it:country_abbreviations} (see below). For an aggregate, use area codes (EA, EU28 etc.) for a list of member states and other countries, use EU 2-digit codes separated by a space and don't use quotes.
{p_end}

{phang}
{opt keepdim()} selects by other dimensions. Just enter the desired values within one dimension, each separated by a space, and do not use quotes. Multiple dimensions can be used, but need not be named and the order does not matter: just separate them by a semicolon.
{p_end}

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The Eurostat repository at {browse "https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database"} contains a large number of EU policy data sets, generally time series (monthly, quarterly, annually). Each series is stored in a separate file that also contains a string-date variable and header with information about the data set.
{p_end}

{pstd}
The following country abbreviations are used by Eurostat and can be used as {it:country_abbreviations} in {hi:geo()}:

{marker install}{...}
{title:Install}

{pstd}
Download or update eurostatuse over SSC (ssc install eurostatuse, replace) or put the eurostatuse.ado file in your personal ado folder. By default, on Windows, the folder is C:\ado\personal\, on macOS it is found within the Stata folder in the library. Put the files in the subfolder e\ to keep it orderly. Stata will automatically search this directory for programs on the next run and have the command ready when you call it.
{p_end}

{pstd}
On Windows, to use the default compressed file transfer, you need to have 7-zip installed into the program files directory (C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zG.exe). If you install it elsewhere or choose for a different decompression tool, the local `exepath' in the ado will need to be changed. MacOS users don't need to do anything. A Linux shell should also be straightforward to add but it is currently not in the ado. For all platforms, using the [uncompressed] option may solve many download and decompression issues.
{p_end}

{pstd}
You can download 7-zip from {browse "http://www.7-zip.org/download.html"}.
