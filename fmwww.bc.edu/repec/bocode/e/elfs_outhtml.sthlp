{pstd}{bf: elfs outhtml} {hline 2} Output Schemes for {cmd:out(html)}


{title:Description}

{pstd}These schemes determine how the ouput appears, using {cmd:out(html)}.

{pstd}If {cmd:class} and {cmd:attributes} are unfamiliar to you, you can consider {cmd:class} to be 'input' and {cmd:attributes} to be 'output':
A command produces text with some {cmd:class}es, and you determine what the result looks like by specfiying the {cmd:attributes} for those {cmd:classes}.

{pstd}In the case of {cmd:outhtml}, both {cmd:class} and {cmd:attributes} are straight {bf:CSS}. 


{title:Fields}

{phang}{cmd:scheme} is the identifier for the whole group of style definitions. This is the identifier you would use in {cmd:out(html, scheme(}{it:scheme}{cmd:))}.

{phang}{cmd:class} is the 'internal' representation of the style, so to speak. All of the {cmd:classes} that are produced by the regular commands are included in all built-in schemes.

{pmore}You can include fewer or more {cmd:classes} in your own schemes:

{phang2}o-{space 2}{cmd:Classes} that are not defined in your scheme will be filled in from the built-in, if necessary.{p_end}
{phang2}o-{space 2}Extra {cmd:classes} that you define can be used by some commands, like {help tlist} and {help html}. Note that {cmd:classes} must be valid {bf:CSS selectors} (eg, they must include the initial dot).

{phang}{cmd:attributes} is a standard {bf:CSS} attribute list (without braces {cmd:{c -(}{c )-}}).{p_end}


{title:Links}

{phang}{cmd:Set Default} sets the scheme to be used by {cmd:out(html)} whenever  no {opt scheme()} is explicitly specified.

{phang}{cmd:Delete} deletes a user-created scheme.

{phang}{cmd:Edit All} opens a data editor with all the defined schemes.
