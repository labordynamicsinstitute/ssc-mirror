<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
Command with menus for evaluating the effect of exposure on a response,
possibly modified by a modifying variable, and possibly controlled for
one or more controlling variables. When a varlist is specified, only
those variables in the varlist are included in the menus. 
<p>
The command produces a menu in which to specify
<p>
<b>The response variable</b>                   often known as the outcome 
<b>The type of response</b>                    binary/metric/failure/count
<b>The follow-up time</b>                      for survival data
<b>The matched set variable</b>                        for matched case-control studie
&gt; s
<b>The exposure variable</b>                   i.e. the main explanatory variable
<b>The modifying explanatory variable</b>      if required
<b>Whether study is matched case-control</b>     for matched case-control studies
<b>Matched set indentifier</b>                 for matched case-control studies
<b>Baseline</b>                                        baseline level for a categorica
&gt; l exposure
<p>
When either the exposure or modifier is categorical, a maximum of 15 values is 
&gt; allowed.
<p>
Selecting Effects produces a sub-menu in which to specify how the
effects are to be measured according to the response:
<p>
<b>metric</b>          differences of means/ratios of means
<b>binary</b>          ratios or differences of proportions/odds ratios
<b>failure</b>         rate ratios/rate differences
<b>count</b>           rate ratios/rate differences
<p>
<b>WARNING</b>: when selecting ratios of proportions, differences in proportions, or
rate differences, there may be problems in convergence with some data sets.
<p>
This sub-menu gives the opportunity to change the units of the effect
to per # when the exposure variable is metric. The sub-menu  also
allows the inclusion of control variables, which can be categorical or
metric. If they are metric they must be selected in the both the control
variables box and in the control variables which are metric box. 
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>clear</b>           Clears previous selections from the menu.
