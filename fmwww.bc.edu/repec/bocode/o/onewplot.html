Description
-----------
<p>
^onewplot^ plots data as a series of marks against a single magnitude 
axis. 
<p>
The vertical scale is (implicitly) 1, ... , number of variables shown
or, if ^by( )^ is specified, minimum value of byvar, ... , maximum 
value of byvar.  
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^onewplot^ differs from ^graph, oneway^:
<p>
    ^graph, oneway^ puts descriptive text under each line of marks. 
    ^onewplot^ puts descriptive text on the axes. 
<p>
    ^graph, oneway^ always shows data marks as short vertical bars, 
    unless ^jitter( )^ is specified.    
    ^onewplot^ allows any symbol to be used for the data marks. The 
    default is a short vertical bar, shorter than that in ^graph, oneway^. 
<p>
    ^graph, oneway^ interprets ^jitter( )^ as replacing short vertical 
    bars by sets of dots. 
    ^onewplot^ interprets ^jitter( )^ in the same way as does ^graph,^
    ^twoway^.
<p>
    ^graph, oneway^ does not allow tuning of ^xlabel( )^ -- the minimum
    and maximum are always shown -- nor of whether a border or axes are
    shown. 
    ^onewplot^ allows such tuning as with ^graph, twoway^. 
<p>
    ^onewplot^ uses only one colour in the body of the graph. 
    ^graph, oneway^ uses several colours with several variables. 
<p>
    ^onewplot^ allows the use of ^xline( )^ and ^yline( )^. 
<p>
    ^graph, oneway^ allows up to 20 variables or 52 groups to be shown.
    ^onewplot^ allows up to 25 variables or groups to be shown. 
<p>
    ^graph, oneway rescale^ stretches each set of data marks to extend over
    the whole horizontal range of the graph. 
    ^onewplot^ allows the ^rescale^ option of ^graph, twoway^, but it has 
    no effect, because internally the graph is of a single y-variable 
    versus a single x-variable, and ^rescale^ only affects graphs with 
    two or more y-variables. 
    
    ^graph^ myvar^, oneway by(^byvar^)^ requires data to be sorted by byvar. 
    ^onewplot^ myvar^, by(^byvar^)^ does not require this. 
<p>
    ^graph^ myvar^, oneway by(^byvar^)^ does not take the values of byvar
    literally: displays for values 1, 2 and 4 will appear equally spaced. 
    ^onewplot^ myvar^, by(^byvar^)^ does take the values of byvar 
    literally.  
    (To tidy up an ordering, use ^egen^ with ^lgroup^ from ^egenodd^ 
    from STB-50.) 
<p>
    ^onewplot^ with the ^stack^ option produces a variant on ^dotplot^ 
    in which the magnitude axis is horizontal. There is no binning of 
    data, unlike that in ^dotplot^. 
<p>
Stata 6.0 will only use at most 8 characters from value labels in 
^xlabel^s or ^ylabel^s.    
   
    
Options
-------
<p>
^by(^byvar^)^ specifies that values of varname are to be shown separately
    by groups defined by byvar. This option may only be specified with 
    a single variable. 
    
    If ^stack^ is also specified, then note that distinct values of any 
    numeric byvar are assumed to differ by at least 1. ^frac( )^ or the 
    prior use of ^egen^ with ^lgroup^ from ^egenodd^ from STB-50 will fix 
    any problems. 
<p>
^stack^ specifies that data points with identical values are to be stacked, 
    as in ^dotplot^, except that the magnitude axis is horizontal and there 
    is no binning of data. 
<p>
^frac(^#^)^ controls the fraction of vertical space taken up by stacked 
    data points under the ^stack^ option above. Default 0.8. This option 
    will not by itself change the appearance of a plot for a single 
    variable or group of data. 
<p>
graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^, other than
    ^xlabel^ by itself and ^ylabel^ by itself.
    
    ^yreverse^ may be useful.
<p>
    The vertical scale may be extended by using ^yscale( )^.
<p>
    ^connect( )^ is allowed but not obviously useful. 
    (For plots with connecting lines, see @parcoord@ from
    STB-29.)
