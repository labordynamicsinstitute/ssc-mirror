<b><u>One Mode Network Projection</u></b>
<p>
        <b>onemode</b> <i>infilename</i> <b>,</b> [ <b>id</b> <b>alpha</b>(<i>real</i><b>)</b> <b><u>mat</u></b><b>rix</b>(<i>string</i><b>)</b> <b><u>edge</u></b><b>list</b>(<i>string</i><b>)</b>
                <b>progress</b> ]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>onemode</b> creates valued, normalized, and signed one-mode network
    projections from two-mode data contained in <i>infilename</i>.  (NOTE: This
    command does not affect the data in memory.)
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
    <b>id</b> specifies that the first column of <i>infilename</i> contains actor IDs.
    <b>alpha</b>(<i>real</i><b>)</b> specifies the alpha-level used for determining the
        statistical significance of edge weights in the construction of the
        signed projection.  The default is 0.05.
    <b>matrix</b>(<i>string</i><b>)</b> specifies the prefix of the comma-delimited output files
        to save the valued (<i>string</i>_valued.csv), normalized (<i>string</i>_norm.csv),
        and signed (<i>string</i>_signed.csv) projections as matrices.
    <b>edgelist</b>(<i>string</i><b>)</b> specifies the name of the Stata data file to save the
        valued, normalized, and signed projections as edgelists.
    <b>progress</b> displays an (approximate) progress meter.
    [For this command to produce output, <b>matrix</b>, <b>edgelist</b>, or both must be
        specified.]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Input</u></b>
    <i>infilename</i> must be a comma-delimited file in which rows represent
    "actors," and columns represent "events," such that cell Aij = 1 if actor
    i participated in event j, and otherwise is 0.  The first column may
    optionally contain alphanumeric actor IDs.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Output</u></b>
    Valued projection -
        * Aij = the number of events in which <i>both</i> actors i and j
        participate.
        * Aii = the number of events in which actor i participates.
<p>
    Normalized projections -
        * Bonacich - Aij is normalized using the equation described by
        Bonacich (1972:179).
        * Pearson - Aij is normalized as the Pearson correlation between <i>i</i>'s
        and <i>j</i>'s attendance profiles.
        * In both cases - Aii = 0.
<p>
    Signed projection -
        * Aij = 1 if actors i and j participate in statistically
        significantly <i>more</i> events together than would be expected if they
        each participated in the same total number of events randomly.
        * Aij = -1 if actors i and j participate in statistically
        significantly <i>fewer</i> events than would be expected if they each
        participated in the same total number of events randomly.
        * Aii = 0.
