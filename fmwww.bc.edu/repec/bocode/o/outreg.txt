TITLE
      'OUTREG': module to write estimation tables to a Word or LaTeX file

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
      
		-outreg- arranges the results of Stata estimation commands in 
		tables as they are typically presented in journal articles, 
		rather than as they are presented in the Stata Results window.
		
		By default, t statistics appear in parentheses below the 
		coefficient estimates with asterisks for significance levels.
		-outreg- provides as complete control of the statistics, 
		layout, and formatting of estimation tables as possible, both 
		in Word and LaTeX files.  Almost every aspect of the table's 
		layout and format (including fonts and Greek letters) can 
		be specified with options.  Multiple tables can be written to 
		the same document, with paragraphs of text in between, 
		creating a whole statistical appendix.

		-outreg- works after any estimation command in Stata.  
		Successive estimation results, with different variables, can 
		be merged into a single table.  In addition to writing a 
		Microsoft Word or a LaTeX file, the reformatted table is 
		displayed in the Results window.
		
		This is a complete rewrite of earlier versions of -outreg-.
