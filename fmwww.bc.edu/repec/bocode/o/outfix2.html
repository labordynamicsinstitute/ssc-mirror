Outputting formatted data
-------------------------
<p>
    ^outfix2^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] ^using^ filename 
    ^, c^ols^(^numlist^)^ [ ^f^ormat ] 
    
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^outfix2^ lists varlist in filename. 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^outfix2^ displays data on screen and logs what it displays in a 
temporary file, which is then copied to a permanent file. Therefore, 
it may not be run ^quietly^ without suppressing its useful output. Any 
logging previously started will be suspended while it is operating. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^cols(^numlist^)^ is a required option specifying the columns in which 
    the values for each variable should start. ^outfix2^ checks only that 
    the numbers in numlist are ascending integers. It is the user's
    responsibility to check that the column specification provides enough 
    space for data to be shown properly. 
<p>
^format^ specifies that the format of each variable should be used in 
    listing. The format may be used to control number of decimal places 
    shown and right- or left-justification. See @format@. 
<p>
<p>
Example
-------
<p>
    . ^outfix2 price weight mpg using auto.out, cols(1 11 21)^

        ^outfix2^ takes ideas from a program ^outfix^ written by Gero 
        Lipsmeier.
