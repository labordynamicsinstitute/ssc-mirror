<b><u>Apply frequency domain filter to time series</u></b>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>fdfilter</b> <i>varlist</i> [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>] <b>,</b> <b>s(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <b>e(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <b>stub(</b><i>abbrev</i><b>)</b>
<p>
    <b>fdfilter</b> is for use with time-series data. You must <b>tsset</b> your data
    before using <b>fdfilter</b>; see help <b>tsset</b>. <b>fdfilter</b> supports the <b>by</b> prefix,
    which may be used to operate on each time series in a panel.
<p>
    <b>varlist</b> may contain time-series operators; see help <b>varlist</b>.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>fdfilter</b> applies the frequency domain filter of Corbae, Ouliaris and
    Phillips (2002) and Corbae and Ouliaris (2006) to one or more time series
    in <i>varlist</i>. Series can be stationary, or can have a unit root. It tends
    to produce output similar to the Baxter-King (1999) filter, though
    without the end-point issue (it estimates end-points directly). The
    filtered series and smoothed series are placed in new variables,
    specified with the <b>stub()</b> option. The smoothed variables are identified
    by "_sm" in their names.  The <b>s()</b> and <b>e()</b> arguments can either specify
    the minimum period of oscillation and maximum period of oscillation of
    the desired component of the time series, with 2 &lt; <i>s</i> &lt; <i>e</i> &lt; infinity, or
    the desired frequencies, with 0 &lt; <i>s</i> &lt; <i>e</i> &lt;= 1. <b>fdfilter</b> does not allow
    gaps within the observations of the time series.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>s(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> and <b>e(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specify the minimum and maximum period of oscillation to be
        retained in the time series, either as the number of periods or as
        the frequencies expressed as fractions of pi. <b>s(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> and <b>e(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> are
        required. For quarterly data, common values are 6 and 32 periods
        (frequencies 1/16 and 1/3) , which preserve the components of the
        data with period between 1.5 and 8.0 years. For monthly data, common
        values are 18 and 96 periods (frequencies 1/48 and 1/9), which
        preserves the component of the data with period between 1.5 and 8.0
        years. For annual data, common values are 2 and 8 (frequencies 1/4
        and 1).
<p>
    <b>stub(</b><i>abbrev</i><b>)</b>, which must be provided, specifies the "stub" from which new
        variable names will be created. Variables created by <b>stub</b> must be new
        variables. If the <i>varlist</i> contains time-series operators, the dots in
        their names are replaced by underscores so that the resulting new
        variables' names are legal.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    . webuse lutkepohl,clear
<p>
    . fdfilter investment, s(6) e(32) stub(FD)
<p>
    Same as above, expressing <b>s()</b> and <b>e()</b> as fractions of pi
<p>
    . fdfilter investment, s(1/6) e(1/3) stub(FDpi)
<p>
    Several variables
<p>
    . fdfilter investment income consumption, s(6) e(32) stub(filt)
<p>
    Time series operators
<p>
    . fdfilter D.investment, s(4) e(12) stub(fl)
<p>
    Application in a panel:
<p>
    . use http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/hayashi/sheston91.dta,clear
<p>
    . drop if country&gt;4
<p>
    . tsset
<p>
    . by country:fdfilter rgdppc, s(2) e(8) stub(fd) k(3)
<p>
    . egen double fd_sm = rowtotal(fd_rgdppc_sm_*)
<p>
    . drop fd_rgdppc_sm_*
<p>
    . egen double fd_res = rowtotal(fd_rgpdpc_*)
<p>
    . drop fd_rgdppc_*
