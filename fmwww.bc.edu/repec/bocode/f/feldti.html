Comparison of two independent coefficients of reliability
---------------------------------------------------------
<p>
     ^feldti^ rel1 rel2, N1() n2() K1() k2()
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
The reliabilities of two tests (^rel1^ &amp; ^rel2^) are compared between
two samples of ^n1^ &amp; ^n2^ subjects. The tests are ^k1^ and ^k2^ items
long respectively.
The independence of the samples is assumed.
<p>
If ^n2^ is not specified, the samples are supposed to be of equal sizes.
If ^k2^ is not specified, the tests are supposed to be of equal lengths.
