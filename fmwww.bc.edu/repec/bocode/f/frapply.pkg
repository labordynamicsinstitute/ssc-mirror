d 'FRAPPLY': module to nondestructively apply command(s) to a frame
d
d  frapply applies a command or a series of commands to the dataset
d in the specified (or current) frame and optionally puts the
d result into another frame. Commands that are otherwise
d destructive (such as drop, keep, collapse, contract etc.) can be
d run serially while preserving the dataset. This can be
d particularly useful in interactive and experimental settings
d where we want to quickly and iteratively summarize and/or
d transform the data without changing it. frapply can also be a
d convenient drop-in replacement for the frames prefix and a
d substitute for frames commands such as frame copy and frame put.
d It can do everything those commands can do in a more flexible
d fashion.
