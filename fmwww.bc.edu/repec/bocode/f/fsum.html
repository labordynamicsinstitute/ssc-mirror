<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>fsum</b> provides summary statistics, including N, # missing, percent missing,
mean, variance, standard deviation, standard error, P1, P5, P25, median, P75,
P95, P99, minimum, maximum, confidence intervals, sum, and percent for 0/1
variables. It can also display categories of a variable in a manner similar to
tabulate. <b>fsum</b> allows Stata labels and special user-defined labels.  Display
width is automatically adjusted for variable and label length. Column width is
adjustable by format, and variable labels are available optionally.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
<b>fsum</b> is a general purpose summary statistic program. Its display can be
formatted with appropriate labels and variable formats so that its output can
be pasted into a word processor without the need for further alterations within
the word processor.
<p>
<b>fsum</b> makes use of 3 potential "labels" to identify each variable.  Stata
abbreviation of varnames can lead to names that are not suitable for
presentation tables or, in some instances, many not be easily readable.
Substitution of variable labels for varnames many not be a complete solution,
for variables labels may be informative yet not suitable for publication
tables.
<p>
<b>fsum</b> provides a facility to use 2 labels: the Stata variable label and a
user-defined label. The user-defined label is actually a variable
characteristic (char) in the format of <b>char</b> varname[tlabel] description-.  See
below for a description of entering user-defined labels.
<p>
<b>fsum</b> will use as its default use the user-defined label if it exists.  If it
does not exist, <b>fsum</b> will use "varname". However, if the -uselabel- option is
specified, <b>fsum</b> will use the Stata variable label before using varname, but it
will do this after first looking for the user-defined label.
<p>
By default, <b>fsum</b> reports N, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum,
essentially mimicking -summarize-. However, many additional statistics are
optionally available, including N, # missing, percent missing, mean, standard
deviation, standard error, variance, median, p1, p5, p25, p75, p95, p99,
minimum, maximum, confidence intervals, sum, and percent for 0/1 variables.
<p>
Percent calculation and reporting is done automatically if the variable for
percent calculation is either 1) entered in the <b>pctvar()</b> option or 2) a "%"
sign is found in the user specified label. The ability to calculate percentages
in this way can save a great deal of time in the creation of presentation
tables, as non-related statistics are left blank.
<p>
If the varlist variable is also entered in <b>catvar()</b> or <b>mcatvar()</b> a tabulation
of categories for the variable will be performed. If a "%" sign or the word
"code" is found in the user specified label, only N, and mean (expressed as a
percentage) will be displayed (miss and abspct can also be optionally
displayed). Otherwise the full range of selected statistics will be displayed.
<p>
If the <b>label</b> option is specified, <b>fsum</b> will display the Stata variable labels
at the right of the screen. If the <b>varname</b> option is specified, <b>fsum</b> will
display the Stata varnames at the right side of the screen, Both options cannot
be selected at the same time.
<p>
The default variable format is %9.2f. This results in a compact output. If the
variable width exceeds this format, the result will be automatically displayed
in exponential form. However, changing the format with the <b>format()</b> option,
will automatically re-space the output and can allow results with greater
output widths to be displayed. The format can be entered as f(w.d) or f(%w.ds).
<p>
If the <b>sum</b> statistic is selected it is automatically formatted as %n.0f.
However, this can optionally be changed to display the general default format/
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>stats(statistic name)</b> allows individual specification of requested statistics.
Default is to display N, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Allowed
stats are N mean vari sd p1, p5, p25, (p50), median, p75, p95, p99,,se, min,
max, uci, lci, sum, miss, abspct. abspct is percent missing.
<p>
<b>addstats(statistic name)</b> allows individual statistics to be added to the
default so as to avoid having to type all stats() when only one or a few
additional statistics are needed.
<p>
Variable names entered in <b>pctvar(varlist)</b> will be treated as 0/1 categorical
variables, and results will be presented as a percent. Variables will also be
treated as a percent if the the % sign is in the user-defined label.
<p>
<b>complete</b> indicates that observations with missing values for the varlist will
be excluded.
<p>
<b>label</b> requests that the Stata variables be displayed at the right of the table.
<p>
<b>not</b> requests that the varnames be excluded. This is useful in handling
variables that differ by stubs or suffixes.
<p>
<b>varname</b> requests that the varnames be displayed at the right of the table.
<p>
<b>uselabel</b> requests that the Stata variable labels be used for the "variable
name" if the user-defined label is not present.
<p>
<b>catvar</b> requests that a tabulation of categories for varname be performed. If a
"%" sign or the word "code" is found in the user specified label, only N, miss,
abspct, and mean will be displayed. Otherwise the full range of selected
statistics will be displayed.
<p>
<b>mcatvar</b> acts similarly to <b>catvar</b> except that it display missing observations as
a separate category.
<p>
The <b>format</b> option allows any formatting desired. The default format is %9.2f.
<p>
<b>decsum</b> requests that the normal format be applied to the <b>sum</b> statistic. The
default if to apply %n.0f.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>User-defined labels</u></b>
<p>
User-defined labels provide the opportunity to make word processor ready
tables. In addition, they can trigger identification of a variable as one for
which percent should be calculated if the % sign is part of the label. User
defined labels are actually variable characteristics in the form of <b>char</b>
<b>varname[tlabel] description</b>. See help for char.  Characteristics (labels) are
saved with the data set.  They can be entered from the keyboard with the <b>char</b>
command. Since such labels will probably be used repeatedly, they can be
entered in a do file or program and called when needed. An example of do file
commands is shown directly below"
<p>
    char haq_disa[tlabel] "HAQ (0-3)"
    char sex[tlabel] "Sex (% male)"
    char age[tlabel] "Age (years)"
    char ethorig[tlabel] "Ethnic origin (code)"
<p>
As an aid, the program <b>nlabel</b> is provided. This program provides a simple way
to create a series of labels at the same time.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    . fsum
    . fsum age sex income haq, f(10.3) s(n abspct mean median p95 sum
    . fsum age sex esr pcs, s(N mean median lci uci sum), l u
    . fsum age sex ethorig pcs,mcat(ethorig) cat(sex)
    . fsum t*, not(totinc) f(%9.1f)
