<b><u>Show names of folders or directories in compact form</u></b>
<p>
        <b>folders</b> [<i>folderspec</i> [<i>folderspec</i> [ ... ]]]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>folders</b> lists the names of folders or directories in compact form.
    Hereafter, folder means "folder or directory", regardless of what you or
    your operating system regard as standard terminology.
<p>
    With no arguments, <b>folders</b> lists names of folders within the current
    folder.
<p>
    Given a <i>folderspec</i> that is a pattern containing <b>?</b> or <b>*</b>, <b>folders</b> lists
    names of folders matching that pattern.  The pattern may include a prefix
    indicating a folder that is not the current folder.
<p>
    Otherwise, given a <i>folderspec</i> that is a folder name, <b>folders</b> lists names
    of folders contained within that folder.
<p>
    The list of foldernames is returned in <b>r(folders)</b>, so long as that is not
    empty.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    The name <b>folders</b> (rather than say <b>dirs</b>) is chosen partly to distinguish
    this command sharply from the inbuilt Stata command dir.
<p>
    It is recommended that even if you use Windows, you use forward slashes <b>/</b>
    rather than backward slashes <b>\</b>.  Stata will understand and there will
    then be no clash with other meanings for the backward slash.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    If you change directory
<p>
    <b>. cd "`c(sysdir_stata)'"</b>
<p>
    <b>folders</b> should then return <b>ado</b> as the name of the sole folder within the
    current folder. If you specify
<p>
    <b>. folders ado</b>
<p>
    <b>folders</b> should then return <b>base updates</b> as the names of the folders in
    that folder. If you specify
<p>
    <b>. folders ado/base/c* ado/base/d*</b>
<p>
    <b>folders</b> should then return <b>c d</b> as the names of all the folders satisfying
    those patterns. If you specify
<p>
    <b>. folders frog</b>
<p>
    <b>folders</b> should then return error 601 as no such folder exists.

    William Gould kindly told me about the subroutine for display in columns,
    which is copied from the source code for classutil.  Kit Baum was a very
    helpful tester.
