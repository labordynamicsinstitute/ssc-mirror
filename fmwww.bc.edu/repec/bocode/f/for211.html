Description
- -----------
<p>
^for^ in Stata 5 includes various features not documented for various
reasons either in the on-line help or in the manual. These include the
use of multiple commands and options for controlling the use of
quotation marks and of macros, which are documented here.
<p>
In addition, ^for211^ includes a new ^numeric^ option and it allows the
use of multiple pairs of quotes within each stata_cmd.
<p>
<p>
Undocumented features
- ---------------------
<p>
^for^ executes stata_cmd1, stata_cmd2, ... repeatedly, substituting each
member of list1 for ^@@1^ in stata_cmd1, stata_cmd2, ... , substituting
each member of list2 (if given) for ^@@2^ in stata_cmd1, stata_cmd2, ...,
and so on until all list members have been processed.
<p>
Up to 10 lists are allowed. The tenth list is referred to as ^@@0^ (not 
^@@10^).
<p>
^for^ may also be used without specifying list1, list2, ... in order to execute
stata_cmd1, stata_cmd2, ... exactly once. In this case the ^@@1^, ^@@2^ ... 
dummy
arguments are not required.
<p>
<p>
Undocumented options
- --------------------
<p>
^any^ is a synonym for ^ltype(any)^.
<p>
^cmdsep(^sep_char^)^ determines the PAIR of characters which separate different
    stata_cmds. sep_char may be any character except backslash, comma, space.
    Don't forget that TWO sep_chars are used to separate stata_cmds. Default
    sep_char: forward-slash (^/^).
<p>
^macro(^macro_string^)^, ^mstub(^stub^)^: when macro_string is found in a 
stata_cmd,
    ^for^ substitutes ^\$^stub and the character which immediately follows
    macro_string. This feature allows you to get access to the contents of
    macros such as ^$S_1^ which are left behind by stata_cmds. The default
    macro_string is ^%%^; the default stub is ^S_^. See also Remarks.
<p>
^numeric^ (in ^for211^) is a synonym for ^ltype(numeric)^.
<p>
^quote(^quote_char^)^ in ^for^ allows you to insert one pair (and no
    more) of quotation marks ("") around part of a stata_cmd. This is
    useful, for example, when setting up variable labels. quote_char
    must be any character not used in any of the stata_cmds. There is no
    default quote_char; it must be specified.
<p>
^quote(^quote_char^)^ in ^for211^ allows you to insert one or more pairs
    of quotation marks ("") around part of a stata_cmd. This is useful,
    for example, when setting up variable labels. quote_char must be any
    character not used in any of the stata_cmds. There is no default
    quote_char; it must be specified.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
- -------
<p>
You may occasionally wish to include a comma or a colon in a list of type 
^any^.
To avoid being mistaken for part of the syntax of the ^for^ command itself,
such characters must be repeated, so ^::^ is translated to ^:^ and ^,,^ to ^,^.
The exception is that ^::^ and ^,,^ may not be followed by space(s), as those
space(s) will be removed. This is a very minor restriction.
<p>
Hash characters (^#^) in stata_cmds (and in list items) are converted to spaces
and may therefore be used to produce literal spaces.  Multiple actual spaces in
stata_cmds are reduced to single spaces. A minor limitation of ^for^ is that
`real' ^#^s are not available.
<p>
Although you can access the contents of a global macro, say ^$S_1^, by 
referring
to it as ^%%1^ in a stata_cmd, you cannot redefine its contents this way. Thus
a command like
<p>
 . ^for^ &lt;stuff&gt; ^global %%1 = ^&lt;value&gt;
<p>
will probably produce a syntax error. Stata will actually see
<p>
 . ^global $S_1 = ^&lt;value&gt;
<p>
and will try to assign &lt;value&gt; to a macro called ^$$S_1^. Instead you should
enter
<p>
 . ^for^ &lt;stuff&gt; ^global S_1 = ^&lt;value&gt;
<p>
to get the expected result.
