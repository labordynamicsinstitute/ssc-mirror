Bar charts showing frequencies of categorical variables 
-------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^fbar^ varname [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    [ ^, by(^byvar^) perc^ent ^t^otalpc { ^f^sort | ^rf^sort } graph_options ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^fbar^ produces a bar chart showing the frequencies (counts or percents) 
of the categories of varname as vertical bars. The default is to show 
counts, as modified by any weights (aweights, fweights and iweights 
are allowed). 
<p>
^fbar^ is a wrapper for ^graph, bar^. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^by(^byvar^)^ means that each category of varname is subdivided by the 
    categories of byvar, and thus represented by a group of bars, or,  
    with the ^stack^ option, by a divided bar. byvar may have up to 6 
    categories in the observations graphed. See @limits@. 
<p>
^percent^ means that results are to be reported as percents.  By default, 
    if ^by()^ is also specified, percents are percents of the total in 
    each category of varname. To override this default, use the ^totalpc^ 
    option. 
<p>
^totalpc^ specifies that percents are to be calculated with respect to 
    the total of all categories. See ^percent^ just above. ^totalpc^ by 
    itself to held to imply ^percent^. 
<p>
^fsort^ specifies that bars are sorted from left to right in order of 
    increasing frequency of varname.
    
^rfsort^ specifies that bars are sorted from left to right in order of 
    decreasing frequency of varname. 
<p>
^fsort^ and ^rfsort^ are mutually exclusive.     
<p>
graph_options are other options allowed with ^graph, bar^. See help for
    @graph@, especially @grbar@ and @grcolor@, including details on ^stack^, 
    ^shading()^ and ^alt^.
