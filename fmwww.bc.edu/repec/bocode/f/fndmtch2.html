Find matching values for one variable in another 
------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^fndmtch2^ var1 var2 [ ^if^ exp ] [ ^in^ range ] [ ^, g^enerate^(^newvar^)^
&gt;  
    ^l^ist ^by(^varlist^) c^ount ^miss^ ] 
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^fndmtch2^ finds observations for which the value of var1 is matched by (is 
equal to) some value of var2, whether for the same observation or for some 
different observation. var1 and var2 should be both numeric or both string. 
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^generate(^newvar^)^ specifies the name of a new variable to hold 
    information on matches. 
    
    By default, newvar is 
    . if observations are excluded from comparison, 
    1 if the value of var1 is matched by some value of var2, 
    and 0 otherwise. 
    
    With the ^count^ option, newvar is   
    . if observations are excluded from comparison, 
    and the number of matches of the value of var1 in var2 otherwise. 
    
^list^ specifies that matching observations should be listed. 
<p>
At least one of ^generate( )^ and ^list^ should be specified. 
<p>
^by(^varlist^)^ specifies that matching is to be carried out only 
    within distinct groups defined by byvarlist. Observations with 
    equal values must belong to the same group to count as matching. 
<p>
^count^ specifies that the number of matches is to be returned.     
<p>
^miss^ indicates that missing values of var1 should be included in the 
    comparison. By default, they are excluded.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
Consider ^a^ and ^b^ and the results of 
<p>
    ^fndmtch2 a b, gen(mtcha)^
    
    ^fndmtch2 b a, gen(mtchb)^
    
    ^a   b mtcha mtchb^ 
    1   5     0     1
    2   6     0     0
    3   7     0     0
    4   8     0     0
    5   9     1     0 
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
    . ^fndmtch2 a b, list^      
    . ^fndmtch2 a b, gen(mtcha)^ 
    . ^fndmtch2 a b, gen(mtcha) by(year)^
