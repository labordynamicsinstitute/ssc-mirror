<b><u>Find and edit text file from within Stata</u></b>
<p>
        <b>fedit</b> <i>filename</i> [ <b>,</b> <i>findfile_options</i> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>fedit</b> finds a text file along the path searched by findfile, which is by
    default the adopath, and then fires up a text editor to examine that
    file. The version of <b>fedit</b> distributed from SSC fires up the inbuilt
    Stata do file editor doedit.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>fedit</b> will be most useful to those wishing to use a text editor of their
    choice from within Stata with minimal typing, in particular without
    spelling out the paths of the file and of the editor executable.
<p>
    Users are encouraged to modify <b>fedit</b> so that it fires up their own
    favourite text editor if they prefer. However, users are explicitly
    warned that it is emphatically not good practice to modify official Stata
    files, even if you really do know exactly what you are doing. Either way,
    users should take full responsibility for what they do with this program.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <i>findfile_options</i> are options of findfile.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. fedit mydo.do</b>
