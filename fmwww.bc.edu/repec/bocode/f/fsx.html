<b><u>Show names of files in compact form (Unix-friendly defaults)</u></b>
<p>
        <b>fsx</b> [<i>filespec</i> [<i>filespec</i> [ ... ]], <b><u>a</u></b><b>ll</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>fsx</b> is a fork of fs. Both commands list the names of files in compact
    form.  Note that files do not include folders or directories.  The change
    in the <b>fsx</b> fork is that it suppresses hidden Unix files by default (much
    like the Stata command ls or the Unix command of the same name). These
    files are revealed with the <b>all</b> option, similar to the "ls -a" syntax in
    Unix.
<p>
    With no arguments, <b>fsx</b> lists names of files in the current folder or
    directory but excludes hidden files. Otherwise, it follows file
    specifications.  A file specification <i>filespec</i> is a filename or (more
    commonly) a set of filenames indicated by the use of wildcards <b>*</b> or <b>?</b>. A
    folder or directory prefix should be given for files outside the current
    directory.
<p>
    See help on dir or ls for listing the names of files with more detailed
    information. Unlike either of those commands, <b>fsx</b> may be given more than
    one file specification. Like dir or ls, but unlike the original fs
    command, <b>fsx</b> suppresses hidden files.
<p>
    The list of filenames is returned in <b>r(files)</b>, so long as that is not
    empty.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    It is recommended that even if you use Windows, you use forward slashes <b>/</b>
    rather than backward slashes <b>\</b>.  Stata will understand and there will
    then be no clash with other meanings for the backward slash.
<p>
    This command has been successfully tested on Windows but is most relevant
    for Unix (i.e., Mac, Linux, Solaris) as these operating systems use
    hidden files marked by leading dots which most Unix users will prefer to
    leave alone.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
 
    <b>all</b> allows a query to return hidden files, which are otherwise
        suppressed. When this option is used, <b>fsx</b> behaves exactly like fs.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. fsx</b>
<p>
    <b>. fsx, all</b>
<p>
    <b>. fsx *.dta</b>
<p>
    <b>. fsx *.ado *.hlp</b>
<p>
    <b>. fsx /ado/plus/f/*.ado</b>
<p>
    <b>. fsx *.gph</b>
    <b>. foreach f in `r(files)' {</b>
    <b>.         graph use `f'</b>
    <b>.         more</b>
    <b>. }</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Saved results</u></b>
<p>
    <b>r(files)</b>     files matching the query
