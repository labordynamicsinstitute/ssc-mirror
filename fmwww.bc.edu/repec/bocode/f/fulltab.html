description
------------
<p>
Suppose you want to tabulate a set of variables, say v1 to v15, each of which
can take on the same possible values (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5) and stack the resulting 
frequencies into a matrix using the ^matcell^ option of @tabulate@.
<p>
A problem appears when one value, say "5", has count 0 (i.e. never appears
in a specific variable, say v12. Then the resulting matrix produced by matcell 
&gt; has
only 4 elements, while the other vectors have 5. And trying to append a row
of the wrong length to a matrix will cause an error.
<p>
^fulltab^ obviates this problem by temporarily adding observations to your
data set, one for each possible value in your list, thus generating full tables
&gt; .
The counts are all off by one and are corrected before exit. And added
observations are dropped.
<p>
Options
--------
<p>
^vals(...)^ is required. It provides the values to be counted.
<p>
^mat(.)^ is required. It provides the matrix name.
<p>
^missing^ is optional. If present counts will be performed on observations
which contain no missing vallues on any of the variables in ^varlist^.
