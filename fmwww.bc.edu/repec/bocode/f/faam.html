Syntax: 
<p>
^faam^ varlist, dim(dimension) gen(scorename)
<p>
^varlist^ needs to contain 21 variables for the computation of the activities o
&gt; f daily
living subscale score. 
^varlist^ needs to contain 8 variables for the computation of the sport subscal
&gt; e score. 
Any kind of variable name is admissible.
<p>
^dim(^dimension^)^ specifies which subscale is scored and needs to be specified
&gt; .
Admissible dimensions are "adl" and "sport".
"adl" indicates computation of the activities of daily living subscale score.
"sport" indicates computation of the sport subscale score.
<p>
^gen(^scorename^)^ specifies the name of the generated subscale score and needs
&gt;  to be
specified.
Any scorename is admissible.
<p>
                  
Examples:
<p>
^faam^ varlist, dim(adl) gen(adlscore)
^faam^ varlist, dim(sport) gen(sportscore)
        
        
Admissible Values:
        
All variables need to be scored from 4 - 0. The following value labels apply:
        
        4: No difficulty at all
        3: Slight difficulty
        2: Moderate difficulty
        1: Extreme difficulty
        0: Unable to do
        
Values outside this range for any variable will terminate the program.
<p>
<p>
Treatment of Missing Data:
        
Missing data is replaced by the mean score for the applicable subscale.
There is a limit of 2 missing values for the activities of daily living subscal
&gt; e.
There is a limit of 1 missing value for the sport subscale.
