<b><u>Change float-type variables to long where possible.</u></b>
<p>
        <b>floattolong</b> [<i>varlist</i>]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    This is simply a convenience, issuing <b>recast long</b> <i>varlist2</i>, where
    <i>varlist2</i> is the set of variables in <i>varlist</i> that are of type <b>float</b>.  This
    has some resemblance to, and is intended to complement <b>compress</b>, but the
    emphasis is on the appropriateness of the type rather than the reduction
    of storage space.  (While <b>compress</b> does potentially change <b>float</b>s and
    <b>double</b>s to integer types, it omits the possibility of changing a <b>float</b> to
    a <b>long</b>, as that does not reduce the storage space.)
<p>
    <b>floattolong</b> would be typically used immediately following (or preceding)
    <b>compress</b>, and saves you the trouble of seeking out all the remaining
    <b>float</b> variables.
<p>
    If no <i>varlist</i> is specified, <b>_all</b> is assumed.
<p>
    <b>floattolong</b> ignores variables that are not <b>float</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. floattolong</b>
<p>
    <b>. floattolong wage income</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>floattolong</b> can be used at any point, but is best used in conjunction
    with (immediately after or before) <b>compress</b>; without <b>compress</b>, it may
    recast some variables to <b>long</b> that might otherwise become <b>int</b> or <b>byte</b>.
<p>
    In general data preparation, <b>floattolong</b> would usually be called without
    a <i>varlist</i>; there is little point in calling it with a specific set of
    variables, since you could just as well type <b>recast long</b> with the same
    <i>varlist</i>.  The exception is where you use it within a program that
    generates a variable that is initially <b>float</b>, and you want to clean up
    that one variable without affecting others.
