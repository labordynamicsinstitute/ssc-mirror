Executes command for each matching file
----------------------------
<p>
    ^forfile^ [filespec] [ ^, d^ir^(^directory^) a^sis ^l^ist cmd('" cmd1 @ | c
&gt; md2 @ "') more]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^forfile^ executes a command for each file matching a 
file pattern.
 
If no command is specified, it does -graph using-
If no filespec is specified, it uses *.gph
<p>
<p>
filespec can take one of the following forms:
<p>
             (nothing) -- treated as ^*.gph^
 ^*^                                   ^*.gph^
 ^*.gph^                               ^*.gph^
 name                                name^.gph^
 name.^gph^                            name^.gph^
 name^*^                               name^*.gph^
 name^*.gph^                           name^*.gph^

Options
-------
<p>
^dir(^directory^)^ specifies a directory or folder in which to look.
    The default is the current directory as indicated by ^cd^.
<p>
^asis^ specifies that graphs should be shown as is. By default, each
    graph is shown with its filename shown as a ^t1title^. ^asis^ turns
    off this feature.
<p>
^list^ specifies that graph filenames should be listed in alphanumeric 
   order. Note that by default (and necessarily) the results of a ^dir^ 
   command are shown on the monitor, although not necessarily in 
   alphanumeric order. 
<p>
^cmd^ executes this command for each file. 
   Put @ where you want the file name replaced
   Put | as separators between commands
<p>
Remarks 
-------
<p>
Except under Unix, any log file open when ^showgph^ is invoked is closed 
temporarily, and the results of a call to ^dir^ are logged to a temporary 
file. Thus such results will not be shown in the log file. The ^list^ option 
should be used if it is desired to have a list of graph filenames in the 
current log file. 
<p>
Under Unix, the system ^ls^ is used to write to a temporary file and any 
log file open is not affected. 
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
    . ^forfile *.gph , cmd(`"graph using "@" "')^
    . ^forfile *.gph , d(\a\folder\) cmd(`"graph using "@" | gphprint"')^
