d '_GCUT': module to recode variables using grouped valuesdd This is a corrected version of _gcut. The version 5.0 code ind error was published in STB-49 as dm66. Its correction appears asd _gcut5.ado. A version 6.0 translation of _gcut is now availabled as _gcut.ado. This is version 1.2 of the software. The option cutd in egen creates a new categorical variable coded with thed left-hand ends of the grouping intervals specified in at(). Itd allows a stata number list to specify the breaks,  (labelled)d integer codes in place of the left-hand ends of the intervals,d and can produce approximately equal frequency groups. dd Author: David Clayton, University of Cambridged Support: email david.clayton@@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.ukdd Author: Michael Hills, University of Durhamd Support: email mhills@@regress.demon.co.ukf _gcut.adof _gcut.hlpf _gcut5.ado
