 statistics in a table within the plot region of the histogram.  It displays
 the mean and points -1sd, -2sd, -3sd, +1sd, +2sd, +3sd away from the mean.The

 descriptive statistics of the sample like median, skewness, kurtosis, p1, P99,
 P5, P95, P10, P90, P25 and P75 are also displayed in the table. The program
 allows the user to specify whether the histogram is to be scaled to density
