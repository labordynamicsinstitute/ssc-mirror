<p>
    <b>hprescott8</b> is for use in Stata 8.2. Users of more recent versions of Stata
    should use <b>hprescott</b>, which makes use of Mata.
<p>
    <b>hprescott8</b> is for use with time-series data. You must <b>tsset</b> your data
    before using <b>hprescott8</b>; see help <b>tsset</b>. <b>hprescott8</b> supports the <b>by</b> prefix,
    which may be used to operate on each time series in a panel.
<p>
    <b>varlist</b> may contain time-series operators; see help <b>varlist</b>.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>hprescott8</b> applies the Hodrick-Prescott (1997) filter to one or more time
    series in <i>varlist</i> which must be under the aegis of <b>tsset</b>. If a panel
    calendar is in effect, the filter can be applied if a single panel is
    specified using <b>if</b> or <b>in</b> qualifiers, or with the <b>by</b> prefix. The default
    smoothing weight of 1600 is applied; this was specified by H-P as
    appropriate for quarterly macroeconomic data. The filtered series and
    smoothed series are placed in new variables, specified with the <b>stub()</b>
    option. The smoothed variables are identified by "_t" in their names.
    <b>hprescott8</b> does not allow gaps within the observations of a time series.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>stub(</b><i>abbrev</i><b>)</b>, which must be provided, specifies the "stub" from which new
        variable names will be created. Variables created by <b>stub</b> must be new
        variables. If the <i>varlist</i> contains time-series operators, the dots in
        their names are replaced by underscores so that the resulting new
        variables' names are legal.
 
    <b>smooth(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the smoothing parameter to be applied. The default is
        1600. Ravn and Uhlig (2002) have shown that the smoothing parameter
        should vary by the fourth power of the frequency observation ratios, so
        that for annual data a smoothing parameter of 6.25 is recommended,
        while for monthly data a smoothing parameter of 129,600 is recommended.
