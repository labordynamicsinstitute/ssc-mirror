Description
-----------
<p>
^hbox^ plots data as one or more horizontal box plots.  
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^hbox^ differs from ^graph, oneway box^ and ^graph, box^:
<p>
    ^hbox^ shows values beyond the quartiles only by whiskers extending 
    to the extremes. No point symbols are used. 
    ^graph, oneway box^ shows whiskers extending to the adjacent values. 
    ^graph, box^ shows such whiskers and point symbols for values beyond
    the adjacent values. 
<p>
    With ^graph^, if you want horizontal box plots, you must have oneway 
    plots as well. 
<p>
    ^hbox^ allows the space taken up by boxes to be tuned by the 
    ^barfrac( )^ option of ^hbar^, but all boxes have the same height. 
    ^graph, box^ allows the width of boxes to vary according to 
    ^vwidth^ and ^root^ options.
    
    ^graph, oneway box^ puts descriptive text under each line of marks. 
    ^hbox^ and ^graph, box^ put descriptive text on the axes. 
    
    ^graph, oneway box^ does not allow tuning of ^xlabel( )^ -- the 
    minimum and maximum are always shown -- nor of whether a border 
    or axes are shown. 
    ^hbox^ allows such tuning as with ^hbar^.
    
    ^hbox^ allows the use of ^xline( )^, in contrast to ^graph, oneway box^,
    although not of ^yline( )^, in contrast to ^graph, box^.
    
    ^hbox^ uses only one colour in the body of the graph. 
    ^graph, oneway box^ and ^graph, box^ use several colours with several 
    variables. 
<p>
    ^graph, oneway box^ allows up to 20 variables or 52 groups to be 
    shown. 
    ^graph, box^ allows up to 6 variables or 50 groups to be shown. 
    ^hbox^ has no limit.    
    
    ^graph^ myvar^, oneway box by(^byvar^)^ or ^graph^ myvar^, box by(^byvar^)^
&gt;  
    requires data to be sorted by byvar. 
    ^hbox^ myvar^, by(^byvar^)^ does not require this. In addition, boxes
    may be sorted by any one of the quantiles shown in the box plots, 
    in either ascending or descending order. 
<p>
    ^hbox^ allows only one variable with ^by( )^. Use ^separate^ to 
    create separate variables for the case of two or more variables. 
<p>
^hbox^ requires installation of ^svmat2^ and ^univstat^.     
 
  
Options
-------
<p>
^by(^byvar^)^ specifies that values of varname are to be shown separately
    by groups defined by byvar. This option may only be specified with 
    a single variable. 
<p>
^total^ is relevant only with ^by( )^. It specifies that an extra box plot
    should be shown for all the values. 
<p>
^qsort( )^ specifies that boxes should be sorted according to the values 
    of one of: the minimum ^min^, the lower quartile ^p25^, the median ^p50^
    or ^med^, the upper quartile ^p75^, the maximum ^max^ or the number of 
    values ^n^ or ^N^. By default with this option, values will be sorted 
    so that the highest value appears at the bottom. Prefixing the measure
    specified with ^-^ reverses this order. Thus ^qsort(p50)^ sorts boxes on 
    the median, highest at bottom, and ^qsort(-p50)^ sorts boxes on the 
    median, highest at top. (^q^ is supposed to evoke quantile, as all of 
    these measures apart from ^n^ are quantiles.) 
<p>
^shown^ (think "show n") specifies that the number of values should be shown 
    in the ^rlegend( )^. By default this is right-justified with a horizontal 
    position ^rlpos(31500)^. 
<p>
hbar_options are options allowed with ^hbar^, except that 
   ^shading(nl..r) t2(" ") l(^names^)^ are hardwired and ^sort( )^ is not 
   allowed.
