^hegy4^ is for use with quarterly time-series data.  You must ^tsset^ your data
&gt;  before 
using ^hegy4^; see help @tsset@.

Description
-----------
<p>
^hegy4^ performs the Hylleberg et al. (HEGY, 1990) test for seasonal unit roots
in a quarterly timeseries. It estimates the four roots of the timeseries
representation (1-B^^4) x(t) = e(t), where B is the backshift operator, and
presents estimates of these roots as Pi(1)..Pi(4). A joint test for Pi(3)=Pi(4)
&gt; =0
is also presented. Critical values are those appropriate for T=100, taken from
HEGY Table 1. Joint tests for Pi(2)=Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0 and Pi(1)=Pi(2)=Pi(3)=Pi(4)=0
&gt; ,
with critical values, are those presented by Ghysels et al. (1994). Critical
values for the case of muliplicative seasonality (see below) are from tables 1a
&gt; -c
in Smith and Taylor (1998). Critical values are linearly interpolated for sampl
&gt; e
sizes in the ranges (48,100) and (100,200).

Options
-------
<p>
<p>
^Det^, which may take on values ^none^, ^const^, ^seas^, ^trend^, ^strend^ or ^
&gt; mult^, specifies
the process to be tested. The default, as suggested by HEGY and Ghysels et al. 
&gt; (1994),
is ^seas^, indicating that a set of 3 seasonal dummies plus constant are to be
included in the regression. ^none^ specifies that no deterministic variables ar
&gt; e
to be included; ^const^ specifies only a constant. ^trend^ specifies that a tre
&gt; nd
is to be included along with a constant term. ^strend^ specifies that a trend i
&gt; s
to be included along with seasonal dummies and a constant term. ^mult^ specifie
&gt; s
that seasonal intercepts (the case of multiplicative seasonality, recommended
by Smith and Taylor (1998)) are to be included along with seasonal dummies and 
&gt; a
constant term.
<p>
^Lags(^numlist^)^ specifies the lag orders to be used in augmenting the model w
&gt; ith
lags of the fourth difference of the timeseries. Its default is zero. If sequen
&gt; tial
lags are specified starting with 1, HEGY4 automatically conducts a sequential t
&gt; -test
to determine the optimal lag length and optimal lags to be included in the auxi
&gt; liary
regression. The ^LEVel(^#^)^ option may be used to control the size of the lag 
&gt; length
test. Note that the test size equals 1 minus the confidence interval (in percen
&gt; t).
Taylor and Smith (2001, p. 204) recommend a test size of 25%, which corresponds
&gt;  to
^LEV(75)^ on the command line. The ^NOTest^ option may be specified to suppress
&gt;  the
lag length test and utilize the lags specified in the option in generating the 
&gt; test
statistic.
<p>
^GEN^erate(^newvar^): as a diagnostic on the procedure, the residuals from the 
&gt; HEGY
regression may themselves be regressed on four lags and the original regressors
&gt; .
The residuals from that auxiliary regression may optionally be saved via the
^GEN^erate() option, which saves them as a new variable. Other diagnostic
procedures (such as a portmanteau test, e.g. ^wntestq^, or tests for normality,
skewness and kurtosis) may be then applied to this variable.
