Hansen's Test for Parameter Instability                      [STB-23: sts7.5]

Tests the null hypothesis of constant parameters from a regression using
^varlist^ against the alternative hypothesis that the parameters follow a
martingale.  ^hansen2^ prints individual statistics for each of the parameters
in the model as well as a statistic for a joint test of all of the parameters.
The test statistics are based on the residuals from the regression model in
^varlist^ estimated over the entire sample.  
<p>
^hansen2^ uses ^tsfit^ (sts4: STB-15; sts4.1: STB-16) to estimate the model, an
&gt; d
all the ^tsfit^ options can be specified.  The ^regress^ option displays the
regression output; the default is to suppress this output.
<p>
Use of ^hansen2^ requires that ^tsfit^ be installed.

Note
----
<p>
        ^hansen2^ differs from ^hansen^ in just one detail.
        Minimal changes were made by Nicholas J. Cox to 
        fix a problem with tempfile names under Windows. 
        Thanks to David Greenberg who alerted Statalist
        to the problem and several Statalist members who
        suggested ideas on fixing it.
