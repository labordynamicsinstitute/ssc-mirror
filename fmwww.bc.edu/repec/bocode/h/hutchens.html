<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>hutchens</b> computes the `square root' segregation index proposed by
    Hutchens (2004) from individual-level data. Hutchens shows that this
    index, call it <i>S</i>, satisfies seven desirable properties for a good
    numerical measure of segregation. In particular, <i>S</i> is additively
    decomposable by population subgroup: total segregation may be expressed
    as the sum of within-group segregation (a weighted sum of <i>S</i> across
    subgroups) plus between-group segregation. <i>S</i> lies on the unit interval,
    with zero representing the complete absence of segregation, and one
    representing complete segregation. If two distributions are unambiguously
    ordered according to a pair of (non-intersecting) segregation curves,
    then <i>S</i> will also order the distributions in the same way.
<p>
    <i>unitvar</i> is the categorical variable summarising social units and <i>segvar</i>
    is the categorical variable defining the social groups who are
    segregated. For example, in a study of occupational sex segregation,
    <i>unitvar</i> would represent occupations and <i>segvar</i> would represent sex.  In a
    study of the educational segregation by family background, <i>unitvar</i> would
    represent schools (say) and <i>segvar</i> would be a measure of family
    background. Note that <i>segvar</i> must be a binary (0/1) variable.  For
    decompositions of <i>S</i> by population subgroup, <i>groupvar</i> is the categorical
    variable defining the subgroups.
<p>
    <i>S</i> is the sum, over all social units, of each unit's shortfall from
    distributional evenness. For each value of <i>unitvar</i>, this shortfall is the
    difference between the geometric mean of the shares of individuals with
    different backgrounds characterized by <i>segvar</i> were there to be no
    segregation, and the geometric mean of the actual shares. See Jenkins et
    al. (2006).
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>bygroup(</b><i>groupvar</i><b>)</b> specifies the decomposition by population subgroups
        defined by <i>groupvar</i>. If the <b>bygroup</b> option is not specified,
        calculations are based on the subset of observations with valid
        values on<i> unitvar</i> and<i> segvar</i>.
<p>
    <b>missing</b> requests that missing values on <i>groupvar</i> be treated like other
        values. (Cases with missing values form a separate subgroup when
        decompositions are done.) <b>missing</b> may only specified if the <b>bygroup</b>
        option is also specified. If the <b>bygroup</b> option is specified and the
        <b>missing</b> option is not specified, then all calculations (including
        aggregate statistics) are based on the subset of observations with
        valid values on<i> unitvar</i>,<i> segvar</i>, and<i> groupvar</i>.
<p>
    <b>format(%</b><i>fmt</i><b>)</b> specifies the format to be used to display the results. The
        default is <b>format(%10.0g)</b>.

<b><u>Methods and Formulae</u></b>
<p>
    Let <i>N</i>(<i>A_j</i>) be the number from social group <i>A</i> in unit <i>j</i> (e.g. the number
    of men who are bankers) and <i>N</i>(<i>A_j</i>) be the number from social group <i>B</i> in
    unit <i>j</i> (e.g. the number of women who are bankers).  The square root
    segregation index <i>S</i> is defined as
<p>
        <i>S</i> = 1 - SUM_<i>j</i> sqrt[ <i>N</i>(<i>A_j</i>)/<i>N</i>(<i>A</i>)} * <i>N</i>(<i>B_j</i>)/<i>N</i>(<i>B</i>) ]      <i>j</i> = 1,...,<i>J</i>
<p>
    or, equivalently,
<p>
        <i>S</i> = SUM_<i>j</i> <i>C_j</i>
<p>
    where the `contribution' of each obs <i>C_j</i> = <i>N</i>(<i>B_j</i>)/<i>N</i>(<i>B</i>) - sqrt[
    <i>N</i>(<i>A_j</i>)/<i>N</i>(<i>A</i>) * <i>N</i>(<i>B_j</i>)/<i>N</i>(<i>B</i>) ], and <i>N</i>(<i>A</i>) and <i>N</i>(<i>B</i>) are the total number of
    obs in groups <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.  The <i>C_j</i> term for a given social unit is the
    shortfall from distributional evenness for that unit (see the earlier
    discussion).
<p>
    For decompositions by population subgroup, suppose that the sample can be
    exhaustively partitioned into <i>G</i> non-overlapping subgroups. Then,
<p>
        <i>S</i> = SUM_<i>g</i> <i>C_g</i>      <i>g</i> = 1,...,<i>G</i>
<p>
    where <i>C_g</i> is the `sectoral contribution' of group <i>g</i>, i.e. <i>C_j</i> summed over
    every obs within group <i>g</i>.
<p>
    For the additive decomposition of <i>S</i> into within- and between-group
    segregation components, Hutchens (2004) shows that:
<p>
        <i>S</i> = <i>SW</i> + <i>SB</i> = [ SUM_<i>g w_g*S_g </i>] + <i>SB</i>
<p>
    where <i>SW</i> is total within-group segregation, <i>S_g</i> is the value of <i>S</i> for
    subgroup <i>g</i>, and `subgroup weight', <i>w_g</i>, is defined as:
<p>
        <i>w_g</i> = sqrt[ <i>N</i>(<i>A_g</i>)/<i>N</i>(<i>A</i>) * <i>N</i>(<i>B_g</i>)/<i>N</i>(<i>B</i>) ]
<p>
    where <i>N</i>(<i>A_g</i>) is the number from group <i>A</i> in group <i>g</i> and <i>N</i>(<i>B_g</i>) is the
    number from group <i>B</i> in group <i>g</i>.
<p>
    <i>SB</i> is total between-group segregation, defined as
<p>
        <i>SB</i> = 1 - SUM_<i>g w_g</i>.
<p>
    Between-group segregation may be interpreted as the amount of segregation
    that there would be if the observations in social groups (defined by
    <i>segvar</i>) were redistributed across social units (defined by <i>unitvar</i>) such
    that the within-unit measure were zero (Hutchens, 2004).
