Description
-----------
<p>
^bicdrop1^ is a post-estimation command that uses the Bayesian Information Crit
&gt; erion
(BIC) to estimate the probability that the model would be more likely after dro
&gt; pping
one of the explanatory variables.  The BIC was first proposed by Schwarz (1978)
&gt;  and 
further developed by Raftery (1995).
<p>
It works after the following estimation commands:
^regress^, ^logistic^, ^logit^, ^ologit^, ^oprobit^, ^mlogit^, ^poisson^, ^nbre
&gt; g^. 
<p>
It also reports Akaike's AIC, an earlier measure of model likelihood, and BIC' 
&gt; (BIC 
prime), an alternative measure proposed by Raftery for model comparison.
<p>
The command drops each explanatory variable from the model and reports the AIC,
&gt;  BIC 
and BIC' associated with the resulting nested model and uses the differences be
&gt; tween 
the BIC for the reduced model and the full (original) model to calculate a 
probability that the model is less likely if that explanatory (or independent) 
variable is removed.
<p>
Note that the BIC difference is not a traditional hypothesis test, but a compar
&gt; ison 
between the likelihood of two models: the original model and the model without 
&gt; one 
of the variables.  Nevertheless, the BIC difference is a more rigourous test of
&gt;  
whether the "true" model (i.e. the most likely model, given the data and the 
likelihood form) contains the variable in question, especially where the tradit
&gt; ional 
significance tests are weak: where N is large; or where there are a lot of 
explanatory variables (where k is large).

This program was based on the approach taken by the command lrdrop1 (developed 
&gt; by 
Z. Wang)  and was suggested by Richard Williams of the University of Notre Dame
&gt; .  
The author is grateful for assistance and encouragement from Richard Williams o

the University of Notre Dame in the testing of this routine.

  ^h^ighlight(^"colour"^) highlights variables which are likely to be part of t
&gt; he model.
      "colour" can be any of "^w^hite" "^g^reen" "^y^ellow" "^r^ed" or "^s^peci
&gt; al"
