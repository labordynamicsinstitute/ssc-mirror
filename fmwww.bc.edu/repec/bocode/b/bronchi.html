<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>bronch</b> calculates the severity of illness for infants presenting with
    bronchiolitis. It relies on four variables age(in months), dehydration
    classified as none(0) mild(1) moderate(2) or severe(3), tachycardia
    (heart rate at or above the 98th centile for age), Increased work of
    breathing defined as (1)for moderate or severe increase in work of
    breathing and (0) otherwise.
  
    This command categorizes bronchiolitis severity as mild, moderate or
    severe using an ordinal logistic regression model.  <b>bronch</b> expects data
    in the wide format i.e. one observation per row and all the required
    variables in that row. When issuing bronch the order in which the
    variables are specified matters. After executing <b>bronch</b> stata issues a
    warning to the user reminding them which variable has been used to
    specify each component in the model. It is the user's to ensure that they
    have correctly specified the variables used to calculate the score.

    <b>nch</b> uses coefficients based on an inpatient derivation dataset. This is
        the default.  The coefficients (odds ratio)for this option are as
        follows. Age *** ()per month, Dehydration ***() per step increase
        from none,mild, moderate, severe, Tachycardia ** (), Increased work
        of breathing** ()
<p>
    <b>olhsc</b> uses coefficients based on an emergency department validation
        dataset.  The coefficients (odds ratio)for this option are as
        follows. Age *** ()per month, Dehydration ***() per step increase
        from none,mild, moderate, severe, Tachycardia ** (), Increased work
        of breathing** ()
<p>
    <b>probabilities</b> calculates the proabability for each observation falling
        within each bronchiolitis severity classification (mild, moderate,
        severe). This option creates three new variables for each observation
        _pmild _pmoderate and _psevere containing the values for the mild
        moderate and severe categories respectively.
<p>
    <b>admit</b> calculates the proabability for each observation of not having mild
        disease. This is the probability of admission when using the <b>ohlsc</b>
        option and the probability of being discharged in less than one day
        with the <b>nch</b> option. This option creates a new variable for each
        observation _padmit.
<p>
    <b>printscreen</b> sends the output to the screen.
<p>
    <b>generate(</b><i>newvar</i><b>)</b> creates <i>newvar</i> containing the value for bronchiolitis
        severity.If not specified the default is bronch.

<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
 The NCH-SOB was derived in one childrens hospital where mild was defined as im
&gt; mediate 
 discharge on review of the resident admission by an attending pediatrician, mo
&gt; derate as 
 hospital admission less than and including median length of stay, and severe d
&gt; isease as 
 admission greater than the median length of stay. The model was validated in a
&gt; nother 
 childrens hospital Emergency Department. In the validation 'mild' severity was
&gt;  based on 
 actual discharge from the  pediatric emergency room by a resident with at leas
&gt; t five years
 post graduate training.  'Moderate' disease was defined as hospital admission 
&gt; less than and 
 including median length of stay, and 'severe' disease as admission for greater
&gt;  than the 
 median length of stay. The median length of stay was the same in both derivati
&gt; on and 
 validation phases. 
 
 
 Both models satisfied the proportional odds assumption. Users may select which
&gt;  coefficents 
 to use based on whether they are dealing primarily with inpatient or outpatien
&gt; t data. Full 
 details of the model used in this severity of illness classification tool can 
&gt; be found in
 reference 1.
