Description
-----------
<p>
^bspline^ generates a basis of B-splines in the x-variate based on a list
of knots, for use in the design matrix of a regression model. ^frencurv^
generates a basis of reference splines, for use in the design matrix of a
regression model, with the property that the parameters fitted will be
values of the spline at a list of reference points. The splines are
either given the names in the newvarlist (if present), or (more usually)
generated as a list of numbered variables, prefixed by the ^generate^ option.
<p>
<p>
Options for use with ^bspline^ and ^frencurv^
-----------------------------------------
<p>
^xvar(^varname^)^ specifies the x-variate on which the splines are based.
<p>
^power(^#^)^ (a non-negative integer) specifies the power (or degree) of the
    splines, eg zero for constant, 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, 3 for
    cubic, 4 for quartic or 5 for quintic. If absent, zero is assumed.
<p>
^knots(^numlist^)^ specifies a list of at least 2 ascending knots, on which the
    splines are based. If ^knots^ are absent, then ^bspline^ will initialize th
&gt; e
    list to the minimum and maximum of ^xvar^, and ^frencurv^ will create a lis
&gt; t
    of knots equal to the reference points (in the case of odd-degree splines
    such as a linear, cubic or quintic) or midpoints between reference points
    (in the case of even-degree splines such as constant, quadratic or
    quartic).
<p>
^noexknot^ specifies that the original knot list is not to be extended. If
    ^noexknot^ is not specified, then the knot list is extended on the left
    and right by ^power^ extra knots on each side, spaced by the distance betwe
&gt; en
    the first and last 2 original knots, respectively.
<p>
^generate(^prefix^)^ specifies a prefix for the names of the generated
    splines, which (if there is no newvarlist) will be named as
    prefix1...prefix`nspline' where nspline is the number of splines.
<p>
^type(^type^)^ specifies the storage type of the splines generated (^float^
    or ^double^). If ^type^ is given as anything else (or not given), then
    it is set to ^float^.
<p>
^labfmt(%^fmt^)^ specifies the format to be used in the variable labels for the
    generated splines. If absent, then it is set to the format of the ^xvar^.
<p>
<p>
Options for use with ^frencurv^ only
--------------------------------------
<p>
^refpts(^numlist^)^ specifies a list of at least 2 ascending reference points,
    with the property that, if the splines are used in a regression model, then
    the fitted parameters will be values of the spline at those points. If ^ref
&gt; pts^
    is absent, then the list is initialized to two points, equal to the minimum
    and maximum of ^xvar^.
<p>
^noexref^ specifies that the original reference list is not to be extended.
    If ^noexref^ is not specified, then the reference list is extended on
    the left and right by ^int(power/2)^ extra reference points on each side,
    spaced by the distance between the first and last 2 original reference poin
&gt; ts,
    respectively. If ^noexref^ and ^noexknot^ are both specified, then the numb
&gt; er
    of knots must be equal to the number of reference points plus ^power+1^.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
The splines generated are intended for use in the varlist of an estimation
command (eg ^regress^ or ^glm^), typically with a ^noconst^ option. The rules
look complicated, but they are designed to give simple defaults for most users
and also a powerful choice of options for programmers and advanced users. The
principles and definitions of B-splines are given in de Boor (1978) and
Ziegler (1969). ^frencurv^ calculates the reference splines by calling ^bspline
&gt; ^
to calculate B-splines for the reference points and for the ^xvar^, and inverti
&gt; ng
the matrix of the B-splines for the reference points to generate a
transformation matrix, which is then used to transform the B-splines for ^xvar^
to reference splines for ^xvar^. The principles and definitions of reference
splines are given in detail by Newson (2000).
