<b><u>Apply Baxter-King band pass filter to time series</u></b>

        <b>bking8</b> <i>varlist</i> [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>] <b>,</b> <b>plo(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <b>phi(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <b>stub(</b><i>abbrev</i><b>)</b> [ <b>k(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b>
                 ]
<p>
    <b>bking8</b> is for use in Stata 8.2. Users of more recent versions of Stata
    should use <b>bking</b>, which makes use of Mata.
<p>
    You must <b>tsset</b> your data before using <b>bking8</b>; see help <b>tsset</b>. If a panel
    calendar is in effect, the filter can be applied if a single panel is
    specified using <b>if</b> or <b>in</b> qualifiers.
<p>
    <b>varlist</b> may contain time-series operators; see help <b>varlist</b>.
<p>
    <b>bking8</b> filters one or more time series using the Baxter-King symmetric
    band-pass filter described in Baxter and King (1995).  If a panel calendar
    is in effect, the filter can be applied if a single panel is specified
    using if or in qualifiers.  The <b>plo()</b> and <b>phi()</b> arguments specify the
    minimum period of oscillation and maximum period of oscillation of the
    desired component of the time series, where 2 &lt; plo &lt; phi &lt; infinity.  The
    "Burns-Mitchell" settings for this filter, applied to quarterly data, are 6
    and 32 quarters, with k=12.
<p>
    You should <b>set matsize 800</b> before calling this routine. Due to the matrix
    size limits, a timeseries longer than 800 periods cannot be handled by this
    routine in Intercooled Stata.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
    
    <b>plo(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> and <b>phi(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specify the minimum and maximum period of oscillation to
        be retained in the time series, and must be given. For quarterly data,
        common values are 6 and 32, which preserve the components of the data
        with period between 1.5 and 8.0 years, with k=12 (which loses three
        years' data from each end of the filtered series). For monthly data,
        common values are 18 and 96, which preserves the component of the data
        with period between 1.5 and 8.0 years. For annual data, common values
        are 2 and 8, with k=3.
<p>
    <b>stub(</b><i>abbrev</i><b>)</b>, which must be provided, specifies the "stub" from which new
        variable names will be created. Variables created by <b>stub</b> must be new
        variables. If the <i>varlist</i> contains time-series operators, the dots in
        their names are replaced by underscores so that the resulting new
        variables' names are legal.
<p>
    <b>k(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the lead-lag length of the filter. This many observations
        will be lost at each end of the filtered series. If not specified, <b>k</b> is
        set to 12 (Baxter and King's recommended value for quarterly data).

This code is based on Eduard Pelz' MATLAB implementation of the Baxter-King
filter, available from

validated against that code for selected series.
