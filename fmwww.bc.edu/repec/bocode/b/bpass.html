Band pass filter for time series data
-------------------------------------
<p>
        ^bpass^ varname pl pu
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^bpass^ filters time series data using an approximation to the 
                band pass filter as discussed in the paper "The Band Pass Filte
&gt; r" by 
                Lawrence J. Christiano and Terry J. Fitzgerald (1999).
<p>
The ^pl^ and ^pu^ arguments specify the minimum period of oscillation and maxim
&gt; um
period of oscillation of the desired component of the time series, where 
0 &lt; pl &lt; pu &lt; infinity.
<p>
The routine outputs a matrix fX which is the filtered time series. 
<p>
You should ^set matsize 800^ before calling this routine. Due to the matrix siz
&gt; e limits,
a timeseries longer than 400 periods cannot be handled by this routine. 
<p>
This program contains only the default filter recommended in Christiano and 
                Fitzgerald (1999). This program was written by Eduard Pelz and 
&gt; any 
                errors are my own and not the authors. For those who wish to us
&gt; e 
                optimal band-pass filters other than the default filter please 
&gt; use the 
                Matlab version of code available at www.clev.frb.org/economists

Examples
--------
<p>
        . ^bpass gdp 6 32^ applied to quarterly data returns component with per
&gt; iod between
                           1.5 and 8.0 years
        . ^bpass ip 2 24^ applied to monthly data returns component with period
&gt;  up to 
                          2.0 years
