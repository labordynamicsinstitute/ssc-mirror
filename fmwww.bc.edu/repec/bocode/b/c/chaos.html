Iterating a logistic difference equation
----------------------------------------
<p>
    ^chaos , r(^#^)^ [ ^c^onnect^(^str^) s^ymbol^(^str^)^  ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^chaos^ iterates for 0 &lt; r &lt; 4 and t = 1, 2, 3, ...
<p>
        x[t+1] = r * x[t] * (1 - x[t])
<p>
starting with x[1] as a random number from the uniform distribution on
[0,1).
<p>
As r increases, the generic behaviour changes from tendency to a single
equilibrium to alternations between two equilibria, between four
equilibria, and so on, successive bifurcations leading to `chaos' for
sufficiently large r.
<p>
^chaos^ presents the user with graphs of x[t] versus t and of x[t+1]
versus x[t].
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
If there are no data in memory, ^chaos^ sets the number of observations
to 200. This is suggested as a suitable number.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^r(^#^)^ is a required option setting r: 0 &lt; r &lt; 4.
<p>
^connect(^ ^)^ can be used to suppress connection of data points. The
    default is ^l^.
<p>
^symbol(^ ^)^ can be used to specify a plotting symbol. The default
    is ^.^
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
    . ^chaos, r(3.99)^
    . ^chaos, r(3.99) c(.) sy(o)^
