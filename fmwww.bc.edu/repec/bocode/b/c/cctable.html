    Univariate case control analysis for each exposure, results are
    summarized into one table. One row, one exposure.
 
    Result file contains: ordering number of exposure(id), name of variable
    (exposure), total number of cases, number of exposed cases, percentage of
    exposed among cases, number of controls, number of exposed controls,
    percentage of exposed among controls, odds ratio, 95%CI interval, 95%
    p-value.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>cctable</b> calculate number and percentage of exposed among cases and
    controls, odds ratio, 95%CI interval, 95% p-value for each variable of 
    <i>varlist</i>.  The result table could be sorted by odds ratio, p-value or
    percentage of exposed.
<p>
    Result could be copied with "copy table" in order to be pasted in Excel.
    Alternatively, the<b> replace</b> option store results as a new dataset. Then,
    results can be exported or saved in a new dataset.

<p>
    <b>exact</b> requests Fisher's exact p be calculated rather than the chi-squared
        and its significance level. Specifying exact is recommended whenever
        samples are small. A conservative rule of thumb for 2x2 tables is to
        specify exact when the least-frequent cell contains fewer than 1,000
        cases. When the least-frequent cell contains 1,000 cases or more,
        there will be no appreciable difference between the exact
        significance level and the significance level based on the
        chi-squared, but the exact significance level will take considerably
        longer to calculate.  Note that exact does not affect whether exact
        confidence intervals are calculated.
<p>
<p>
    <b>nosort</b> Specifies that the order of the exposures will be the same in the
        result table as it was in the command.
<p>
    <b>or</b> Results will be sorted by odds ratio in descending order.
<p>
    <b>pe</b> Results will be sorted by percentage of exposed among cases in
        descending order.
<p>
<p>
    <b>pvalue</b> Results will be sorted by p-value in ascending order. If no other
        sorting option is used, results will be sorted by ascending p-value
        as default.
<p>
    <b>replace</b> Specifies that the result table will<b> replace</b> the original dataset
        in the memory and it will appear in the browser window. It means that
        the original dataset will be deleted from the memory.<b>  preserve</b> then
        <b>restore</b> may be used to get back the original dataset, or upload it
        again with the<b> use</b> command.<b>  replace</b> is used to create dataset from
        the result table (e.g. to save it), or to solve "copy table"
        incompatibilities in certain cases.
<p>
    <b>noabbreviate</b> Displays full exposure name (default 12 first chars).
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
    As with the <b>cc</b> command, variables used with <b>cctable</b> must be coded as 0/1.
    Sorting results only available in version 9
