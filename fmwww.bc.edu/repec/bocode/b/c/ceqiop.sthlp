{hi:ceqiop} {hline 2} Estimates ex-ante inequality of opportunity by income concept for sheet "E4. Inequality of Opportunity" of the CEQ Master Workbook 2016

{pstd}
{ul:Caution:} The construction of the CEQ income concepts Market Income, Market Income plus Pensions, Net Market Income, Gross Income, and Taxable Income will differ depending on which scenario for the public contributory pension system has been chosen. In the public contributory Pensions as Deferred Income (PDI) scenario, pension system income is treated as (Market) income earned previously deferred until today; while pension system contributions are treated as mandatory savings (income deferred to one’s future self).  In contrast, the contributory Pensions as Government Transfer(PGT) scenario, pension system income is treated as a pure transfer (from the fisc), while pension system contributions are treated as a tax. In the PDI scenario pensions are prefiscal income while in the PGT scenario the public contributory pension system is a fiscal tax and transfer system that redistributes income from today’s working-age population to today’s pension-age population.  When the user wishes to analyze both PDI and PGT scenarios, this command must be run twice: once for outputting information generated under the PDI scenario to a Masterworkbook (section E); and again for outputting information generated under the PGT scenario to its own Masterworkbook (section E).  See also the Income concepts options section below for more detail.

{title:Required packages}

{pstd}
{cmd:ceqiop} requires installation of {cmd:oppincidence} (Higgins, 2012), which is part of the CEQ Stata Package; to install, {stata ssc install ceq, replace:ssc install ceq, replace}.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ceqiop} measures ex-ante inequality of opportunity for each of the CEQ core
income concepts, following the non-parametric method in Ferreira and Gignoux (2011).
Circumstance sets are specified by the variables in {opth groupb:y(varlist)}. For example, one circumstance set could be
(female, black, parents were college graduates, urban): all individuals with those four traits are grouped together in
one circumstance set. Circumstances are pre-determined factors that are not dependent on an
individual’s effort, such as race, gender, and parents’ education or parents’ income. A smoothed income distribution
is created by assigning each individual the mean income of the individuals in his or
her circumstances set. Inequality (measured using mean log deviation) of the smoothed income distribution for each income
concept gives the measure of inequality of opportunity in levels by income concept.
This is labeled "In levels". Dividing the resulting measure by the
mean log deviation for the actual income distribution measures the ratio of inequality
due to inequality of opportunity as opposed to inequality of effort. This is labeled "In ratios".

{pstd}
If the data set is at the individual level (each observation is an individual), the variable with the
identification code of each household (i.e., it takes the same value for all members within a
household) should be specified in the {opth hh:id(varname)} option; the {opth hs:ize(varname)} option
should not be specified.
Furthermore, since the circumstance variables specified in {opth gr:oupby(varlist)}
could be defined at the individual level, for data sets at the individual level, the
condition identifying household heads must be specified. For example, if we have a
variable called {cmd:hh_status} that takes a value of 1 for the household head, 2
for the spouse, etc., we would specify {cmd:head(hh_status==1)}. If a variable name
is given rather than a condition, e.g. {cmd:head(hh_status)}, {cmd:ceqiop} assumes
that household heads are individuals for whom that variable is equal to 1.

{pstd}
If the data set is at the household level, the number of members in the
household should be specified in {opth hs:ize(varname)}; the {opth hh:id(varname)} option should not be
specified. Furthermore, the variables given in {opth gr:oupby(varlist)} should
be variables for the household head, e.g. a variable for gender would indicate the
gender of the household head.
In either case (household or individual level data set), the weight used should be the household sampling weight and should {it:not}
be multiplied by the number of members in the household since the program will do this multiplication
automatically in the case of household-level data.

{pstd}
There are two options for including information about weights and survey sample design for accurate
estimates and statistical inference. The sampling weight can be entered using
{weight} or {help svyset}. Information about complex stratified sample designs can also be entered
using {help svyset} since {cmd:ceqiop} automatically uses the information specified using {help svyset}.
Alternatively, the primary sampling unit can be entered using the {opth psu(varname)} option and
strata can be entered using the {opth s:trata(varname)} option.

{pstd}
By default, {cmd: ceqiop} does not allow income concept or fiscal intervention variables to have missing
values: if a household has 0 income for an income concept, receives 0 from a transfer or a subsidy,
or pays 0 of a tax, the household should have 0 rather than a missing value. If one of these variables has
missing values, the command will produce an error. For flexibility, however, the command includes an
{opt ignorem:issing} option that will drop observations with missing values for any of these variables, thus
allowing the command to run even if there are missing values.

{pstd}
Negative incomes are allowed, but a warning is issued for each core income concept that
has negative values (or positive values when a fiscal intervention is stored as negative values). This is because
various measures are no longer well-behaved when negative values are included (for example, the Gini coefficient,
concentration coefficient, or squared poverty gap can exceed 1, and other desirable properties of these measures
when incomes are non-negative no longer hold when negative values are allowed).

{opt using} is required, and indicates the filename for the output. Results are automatically exported to the CEQ Master Workbook Output Tables if
{cmd:using} {it:filename} is specifed in the command, where {it:filename} is the Master Workbook. By
default, {cmd:ceqiop} prints to a sheet titled "E4. Inequality of Opportunity"; the user can override the sheet name
using the {opt sheet(string)} option. Exporting directly to the Master Workbook requires Stata 13 or
newer. The Master Workbook populated with results from {cmd:ceqiop} can be automatically opened if the
{opt open} option is specified (in this case, {it:filename} cannot have spaces). Results are also
saved in matrices available from {cmd:return list}. To produce only a portion of the results, specify
only a subset of the income concept options.

{p 8 8 2}
Notice that if the user wishes to do the CEQ {it} Assessment {sf} for both the {bf: "pensions as deferred income scenario"} and
{bf: "pensions as government transfer scenario"}, the ado does {bf: NOT} run both scenarios automatically. The user must run the
ado twice, one time per scenario (see Income concepts options for an explanation on the differences across
scenarios), and create two separate sets of E sheets. Hence, {it:filename} should be changed accordingly.

The CEQ core income concepts include market income, market income plus pensions, net market income, gross income,
taxable income, disposable income, consumable income, and final income. The variables for these income
concepts, which should be expressed in local currency units (preferably {bf:per year} for ease of comparison
with totals from national accounts), are indicated using the {opth m:arket(varname)}, {opth mp:luspensions(varname)},
{opth n:etmarket(varname)}, {opth g:ross(varname)}, {opth t:axable(varname)}, {opth d:isposable(varname)},
{opth c:onsumable(varname)}, and {opth f:inal(varname)} options.

{pstd}
The public contributory old-age pension system can be incorporated into a CEQ Assessment as deferred income or as a government transfer (for a detailed discussion regarding
the alternatives see Lustig (2018) available at {browse "http://commitmentoequity.org/publications-ceq-handbook"}). The decision regarding the public contributory pension system can have a significant impact on assessing the redistributive power of a fiscal system, especially in countries with a high proportion of retirees and large spending on social security. The construction of Market income, Market income plus pensions, Gross income, Net market income, and Taxable Income will differ between the PDI and PGT scenarios (while Disposable income, Consumable income and Final income are equivalent in value in both scenarios). The user must create two separate sets of E sheets, one per scenario (for a more detailed
explanation see {cmd: using} in {help ceqlorenz##cor:core options}).

{pstd}
In CEQ {it} Assessments {sf} in the {bf: "pensions as deferred income scenario"}, it is assumed that contributions
during working years are a form of “forced saving” and income concepts are defined in the following way:

{p 16 16 10}
Market income given by {opth m:arket(varname)} as factor income (wages and salaries and income from capital) plus private transfers
 (remittances, private pensions, etc.) {bf: PLUS} imputed rent and own production {bf: MINUS} contributions to social insurance old-age pensions.

{p 16 16 10}
Market income plus pensions given by {opth mp:luspensions(varname)} as Market income (PDI) {bf: PLUS} contributory social
 insurance old-age pensions. Prefiscal income (PDI) is defined as Market income plus Pensions (PDI).

{p 16 16 10}
Gross Income given by {opth g:ross(varname)} as Market Income plus pensions (PDI) {bf: PLUS} direct cash and near cash
transfers (conditional and unconditional cash transfers, school feeding programs, free food transfers, etc.).

{p 16 16 10}
Net Market Income given by {opth n:etmarket(varname)} as Market Income plus pensions (PDI) {bf: MINUS} direct taxes
and {bf: MINUS} non-pension social contributions.

{p 16 16 10}
Taxable income given by {opth t:axable(varname)} as Gross Income (PDI) {bf: MINUS} all non-taxable Gross Income components.

{p 16 16 10}
Disposable income given by {opth d:isposable(varname)} as Market Income plus pensions (PDI) {bf: PLUS} all direct transfers
 {bf: MINUS} all direct taxes and non-pension social contributions.


{pstd}
In the {bf: "pensions as government transfer scenario"}, it is assumed that pensions are a pure government transfers and income concepts are defined in the following way:

{p 16 16 10}
Market income given by {opth m:arket(varname)} as factor income (wages and salaries and income from capital) plus private transfers
 (remittances, private pensions, etc.)  {bf: PLUS} imputed rent and own production. Prefiscal income (PGT) is defined as Market income (PGT).

{p 16 16 10}
Market income plus pensions given by {opth mp:luspensions(varname)} as Market income (PGT) {bf: PLUS} contributory social insurance old-age pensions.

{p 16 16 10}
Gross Income given by {opth g:ross(varname)} as Market Income plus pensions (PGT) {bf: PLUS} direct cash and near cash transfers (conditional and
 unconditional cash transfers, school feeding programs, free food transfers, etc.).

{p 16 16 10}
Net Market Income given by {opth n:etmarket(varname)} as Market Income (PGT) {bf: MINUS} direct taxes and {bf: MINUS}  non-pension
social contributions.

{p 16 16 10}
Taxable income given by {opth t:axable(varname)} as Gross Income (PGT) {bf: MINUS} all non-taxable Gross Income components.

{p 16 16 10}
Disposable income given by {opth d:isposable(varname)} as Market Income (PGT) {bf: MINUS}  all direct taxes {bf: PLUS} pension income {bf: PLUS}
 all other direct transfers {bf: MINUS} all pension and non-pension social contributions.


{pstd}
The construction of Consumable and Final income is done in the same way in both the PDI and PGT scenarios:

{p 16 16 10}
Consumable income given by {opth c:onsumable(varname)} as Disposable Income {bf: PLUS} indirect subsidies (energy, food and other general
 or targeted price subsidies) and {bf: MINUS} indirect taxes (VAT, excise taxes, and other indirect taxes).

{p 16 16 10}
Final income given by {opth f:inal(varname)} as Consumable income {bf: PLUS} Monetized value of in-kind transfers in education and health
 services at average government cost and {bf: MINUS} co-payments and user fees.
