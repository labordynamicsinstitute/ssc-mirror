Title: ContagT: GAUSS module to implement a pairwise bootstrap test for contagion.

Abstract:  This GAUSS module performs the Hatemi-J and Hacker (2005) pairwise 
bootstrap test for contagion during financial crisis and it also gives pairwise bootstrap estimators and 
the corresponding bootstrap P-values as suggested by the authors.
For technical description see the published paper.
