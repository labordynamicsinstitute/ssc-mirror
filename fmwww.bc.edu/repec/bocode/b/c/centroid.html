Calculating centroids
---------------------
<p>
centroid ^varlist^ if ^exp^ in ^exp^ [weight], group(^groupvar^) [dist(#)]
<p>
The program ^centroid^ takes as input a set of variables and a grouping 
variable, which is designated ^groupvar^.  ^Groupvar^ indicates into which 
group each case falls.  As output, it generates a set of group ^centroids^,
which are means of each variable in ^varlist^, and a set of distances, which
indicate how far each case is from each centroid.
<p>
Output is as follows:
Let g be the number of levels of ^groupvar^.
Let v be the number of variables in ^varlist^.
<p>
CENTij, for i=1,...,g;j=1,...,v: 
                The mean of the ith group on the jth variable. 
<p>
DISTi, for i=1,...g:
                The distance of each case from the ith centroid.
<p>

Distance option
---------------
"Distance" is calculated by the Minkowski metric with parameter specified
by the dist(#) option.  If you do not specify this option, Euclidean distance
is assumed (#=2).  Allowable values are greater than or equal to 1.
