<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>catplot</b> shows frequencies (or optionally fractions or percents) of the
    categories of one, two or three categorical variables. The first named
    variable is innermost on the display; that is, its categories vary
    fastest.  The syntaxes <b>catplot bar</b>, <b>catplot hbar</b> and <b>catplot dot</b> are
    specified to indicate use of graph bar, graph hbar and graph dot
    respectively. The choice is a matter of personal taste, although in
    general horizontal displays make it easier to identify names or labels of
    categories.
<p>
    <b>fweight</b>s, <b>aweight</b>s and <b>iweight</b>s may be specified.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    The default display with <b>bar</b> and <b>hbar</b> is graphically conservative,
    reflecting the view that height of bars and text indicating categories
    are the best ways of conveying information. If you wish also to have bars
    in different colours, specify the option <b>asyvars</b>, which differentiates
    the categories of the <i>first</i> named variable <i>catvar1</i>. If you wish also to
    stack bars of different colours, specify the further option <b>stack</b>.
<p>
    The default display with <b>dot</b> is similarly conservative.  If you wish to
    have point symbols in different colours, specify the option <b>asyvars</b>,
    which differentiates the categories of the <i>first</i> named variable <i>catvar1</i>.
    If you wish also to use different point symbols, use the further option
    <b>marker()</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>fraction</b> indicates that all frequencies should be shown as fractions
        (with sum 1) of the total frequency of all values being represented
        in the graph.
<p>
    <b>fraction(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b> indicates that all frequencies should be shown as
        fractions (with sum 1) of the total frequency for each distinct
        category defined by the combinations of <i>varlist</i>. For example, given a
        variable <b>sex</b> with two categories male and female, the fractions shown
        for male would have sum 1 and those for female would have sum 1.
<p>
    <b>percent</b> indicates that all frequencies should be shown as percents (with
        sum 100) of the total frequency of all values being represented in
        the graph.
<p>
    <b>percent(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b> indicates that all frequencies should be shown as
        percents (with sum 100) of the total frequency for each distinct
        category defined by the combinations of <i>varlist</i>.  For example, given
        a variable <b>sex</b> with two categories male and female, the percents
        shown for male would have sum 100 and those for female would have sum
        100.
<p>
    Only one of these <b>fraction</b>[<b>()</b>] and <b>percent</b>[<b>()</b>] options may be specified.
<p>
    <b>missing</b> specifies that any missing values of any of the variables
        specified should also be included within their own categories.
<p>
    <b>sort</b> specifies that values shown should be sorted in each category
        (higher values at the bottom of each category).  Sorting is applied
        to all variables shown.
<p>
    <b>descending</b> specifies that sorted values should be shown in descending
        order (higher values at the top of each category).
<p>
    <i>graph_options</i> refers to options of graph bar, graph hbar or graph dot as
        appropriate.  <b>by()</b> is one useful example.
<p>

    . catplot hbar rep78 foreign, percent(foreign) bar(1, bcolor(blue))
        blabel(bar, position(outside) format(%3.1f)) ylabel(none)
        yscale(r(0,60))
