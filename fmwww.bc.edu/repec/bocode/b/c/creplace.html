<b><u>Exchange values cyclically between variables</u></b>

        <b>creplace</b> [ <i>varlist</i> ] [<i>if</i>] [<i>in</i>] [ , <b><u>pr</u></b><b>evious</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>creplace</b> is an extended version of <b>replace</b>, which exchanges values
    cyclically between variables in a list of two or more variables.  By
    default, the values in each variable are replaced by values from the next
    variable in the list, or by values from the first variable, in the case
    of the last variable.  Optionally, the values in each variable are
    replaced by values from the previous variable in the list, or by values
    from the last variable, in the case of the first variable.  If there are
    only two variables in the list, then their values will simply be
    exchanged.  Variables in the list must be all numeric or all string.
    After exchanging the values, <b>creplace</b> will <b>compress</b> these variables to
    the smallest storage type possible without loss of information.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options for </u></b><b><u>creplace</u></b>
<p>
    <b>previous</b> specifies that the values of each variable in the list will be
        replaced by values from the previous variable in the list, or by
        values from the last variable in the list, in the case of the first
        variable in the list.  If <b>previous</b> is not specified, then the values
        of each variable in the list will be replaced by values from the next
        variable in the list, or by values from the first variable in the
        list, in the case of the last variable in the list.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b>creplace</b> can cyclically exchange values between a list with any number of
    variables greater than one.  However, in most cases, there will only be
    two variables, and their values will be exchanged pairwise, at least in
    the subset of observations specified by the <b>if</b> and <b>in</b> qualifiers.
<p>
    <b>creplace</b> is commonly used in output datasets (or resultssets) produced by
    the <b>parmest</b> package, downloadable from SSC.  Such output datasets have
    one observation for each of a set of estimated parameters, and data on
    estimates and lower and upper confidence limits, which are stored in
    three variables.  The user may replace the values of these variables to
    perform an end point transformation on the confidence intervals.  If the
    end point transformation is decreasing, then the user may use <b>creplace</b> to
    exchange values of the lower and upper confidence limits, after the
    transformation has been performed.
