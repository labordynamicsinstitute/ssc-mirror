<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<p>
    <b>crtest</b> performs the Cramer-Ridder test for pooling states in the
    Multinomial logit model.
<p>
                
<b><u>Examples</u></b>

<b><u>Technical details</u></b>
<p>
    This test assume a multinomial logit model with (S+1) states and two
    states that are candidates for pooling, s1 and s2. The null hypothesis is
    that s1 and s2 have the same regressors coefficient apart from the
    intercept, or
<p>
                                Bs1 = Bs2 = Bs (1)
                                
    To test this hypothesis the following test statistics can be used:
                             
                                LR = 2{lnL - lnLr} (2)
                             
    where lnL is the maximum log likelihood of the original model and lnLr
    the maximum log likelihood if the estimates are constrained to satisfy
    (1).  LR asymptotically has a chi-square distribution with k degrees of
    freedom where k is the number of restrictions implied by (1). LnL is
    readily available from the original model, but the lnLr apparently
    requires constrained estimation which can be quite laborious.
<p>
    Cramer and Ridder (1991) show that the lnLr can be easily derived from an
    unconstrained estimation of the pooled model with only S states. The
    following expression to estimate the restricted maximum log likelihood is
    then presented by the authors,
<p>
                                lnLr = ns1*ln(ns1) + ns2*ln(ns2) - ns*ln(ns) +
lnLp
<p>
    where lnLp is the unconstrained maximum of the log likelihood of the
    pooled model. ns1 and ns2 are the number of observations on the states s1
    and s2, respectively, and ns = ns1 + ns2.
