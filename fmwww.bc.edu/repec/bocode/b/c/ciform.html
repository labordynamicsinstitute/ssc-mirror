Formatting numeric variables as a confidence interval for tables in documents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^ciform^     [varlist] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] , ^n^ewvars(newvarlist)
                       [ ^f^ormat(format) ]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^ciform^ takes, as input, a list of 3 numeric variables, assumed to contain
estimates, lower confidence limits and upper confidence limits, respectively,
It creates, as output, a list of 3 new string variables, containing the 3
numeric input variables formatted as a confidence interval. These new variables
are intended to be output using ^outsheet^ and imported into word processors or
spreadsheets (or even TeX) to be incorporated into tables. ^ciform^ is intended
for use after ^parmest^ (STB-49, May 1999), which saves a model fit as a new
data set, with 1 observation per parameter of the most recently fitted model, a
&gt; nd
variables containing point estimates and confidence limits. If ^varlist^ is
absent, then ^ciform^ searches for variables called ^estimate^,
^min$S_level^ and ^max$S_level^ (as created by ^parmest^), where ^S_level^ is 
the global macro containing the current confidence level.

Options for use with ^ciform^
--------------------------
<p>
^newvars^ specifies a list of 3 new string variables, containing the input
    variables formatted as a confidence interval, with commas and parentheses
    added to the lower and upper limits as appropriate.
<p>
^format^ specifies the format to be used for the confidence interval. If
^format^ is not specified, then ^ciform^ uses the format of the first variable 
    in ^varlist^.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^ciform^ is designed to be used after ^parmest^ and before
^outsheet,noquote^ when creating tables of confidence intervals in a document. 
It saves the labour of manually reformatting the estimates and confidence limit
&gt; s 
and keying in the commas and parentheses one by one inside a word processor 
(or even a text editor in preparation for input to TeX). The output worksheet 
is typically a tab-delimited text file. The user can cut and paste this output 
into a word processor, or replace all the tabs with ampersands and all the 
^&lt;newline&gt;^s with ^\cr&lt;newline&gt;^ and then cut and paste the result into a TeX 
table.
