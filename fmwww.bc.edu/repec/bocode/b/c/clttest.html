Description
-----------
This program calculates a cluster-adjusted t-value for comparing
continous outcomes when the unit of randomization is a cluster. 
It calculates the adjusted t-value based on the effects of 
clustering by ^byvar^ group. See reference below for formulae.
The results include cluster adjusted means and confidence intervals
for each group; the difference between these; and, for stratified
data, the variance weighted mean difference. The ICC is calculated
separately for each group. 
<p>
^outvar^ is a continous outcome variable. It must be clustered 
  within ^clustvar^.
^clustvar^ is a categorical variable denoting clusters of observations.
  It is ^not^ optional.
^byvar^ is a dichomotous variable denoting groups to be compared.
  It is ^not^ optional.
<p>
^stratavar^ is a categorical variable denoting strata of groups.
<p>
Note: This program does not yet support comparison of two variables
analogous to the ttest var1=var2 command.

Example
-------
<p>
  . ^clttest score, cluster(school) by(control)^
<p>
where observations of ^score^ are clustered within ^school^, and
the comparison is made between the two groups identified by ^control^.
