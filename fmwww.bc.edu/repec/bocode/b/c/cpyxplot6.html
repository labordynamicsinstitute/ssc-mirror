Scatter plots for each y vs each x variable
-------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^cpyxplot6^ yvarlist \ xvarlist [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    [ ^,^ graph_options ^text^size^(^#^)^ ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^cpyxplot6^ produces an array of scatter or twoway plots for yvarlist
versus xvarlist. There is one plot for each y variable from yvarlist and
each x variable from xvarlist. The name ^cpyxplot6^ is derived from
Cartesian product of y and x. ^cp^ may also be interpreted as `cross
pairs'. The backslash ^\^ must be used to separate the yvarlist and the
xvarlist.
<p>
A neat arrangement of the individual graphs is produced if the
number of y variables is equal to the number of x variables, or the
number of y variables is 1, or the number of x variables is 1.
<p>
^cpyxplot6^ is the original version for Stata 6, renamed but otherwise
frozen as is, on 21 November 2004. Users of Stata 8 upwards should use
^cpyxplot^ instead.

Options

graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^ or ^graph using^.
    Note that
<p>
    1. ^margin( )^, ^saving( )^ and ^title( )^ apply to the combined
    graph.
<p>
    2. all other options, including ^b1( )^, refer to all the individual
    graphs.
<p>
^textsize(^#^)^ temporarily sets textsize to #% of the default.
