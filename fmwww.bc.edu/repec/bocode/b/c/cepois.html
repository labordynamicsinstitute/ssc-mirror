Censored Poisson Regression
------------------------------
<p>
  ^cepois^ depvar [varlist] [weight] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]  
            [, ^cen^sor(^var^)^ l^evel ^eform^ ^off^set(^var^)
               ^e^xposure(^var^) ^R^obust ^CL^uster(^var^) ]
<p>
The ^censor^ option is required. If no observations are censored,
all values of the censor variable have the value of ^1^. Left 
censoring is indicated with censor values of ^0^; right 
censoring with values of ^-1^. A non-censored model is identical 
to a Poisson model.
<p>
^fweights^, ^aweights^, and ^pweights^ are allowed; see help @weights@.
  
Options
-------
<p>
^level^(^#^) specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence 
intervals. The default is ^level^(^95^) or as set by ^set level^.
<p>
^eform^ reports estimated coefficients transformed to incidence ratios, i.e., 
e to the power of b rather than b. Standard errors and confidence intervals 
are similarly transformed. This option affects how results are displayed, 
not how they are estimated. 
<p>
^offset^(^varname^) specifies a variable that is to be entered
directly into the log-link function with coefficient constrained to be 1.
One must log (ln) the offset variable prior to entering it as an offset.
<p>
^exposure^(^varname^) specifies a variable that is to be entered
directly into the log-linked function. ^exposure^ is the natural log 
of the variable entered as an offset.
<p>
^robust^ specifies that the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance is 
to be used in place of the traditional calculation; see [U] 23.14 
Obtaining robust variance estimates.  robust combined with cluster() 
allows observations which are not independent within cluster (although 
they must be independent between clusters).
<p>
^cluster^(^varname^) specifies that the observations are independent across 
groups (clusters) but not necessarily within groups.  varname specifies 
to which group each observation belongs; e.g., ^cluster^(^personid^) in data
with repeated observations on individuals.  cluster() can be used with 
pweights to produce estimates for unstratified cluster-sampled data, but 
see help svypoisson for a command especially designed for survey data.
Specifying cluster() implies robust.
