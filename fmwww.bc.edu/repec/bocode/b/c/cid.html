^cid^ calculates confidence intervals (CIs) for means or differences.
<p>
In the first form, ^cid^ calculates a CI for the mean of varname.
<p>
In the second form, ^cid^ produces a CI for mean difference between varname1 an
&gt; d
varname2.  Data are assumed to be paired, but ^unpaired^ changes this assumptio
&gt; n.
<p>
In the third form, ^cid^ gives a CI for the mean difference across the two grou
&gt; ps
defined by groupvar.  Data are assumed paired, but ^unpaired^ reverses this.

^median^ calculates CI's as above, except for medians rather than for means.
    CI's are determined by rank-based methods as described in Gardner and
    Altman's (1989) book "Statistics with Confidence", pp. 74-79.  A normal
    approximation with a continuity correction of 0.5 is used, rather than
    tables of exact values.  The accuracy should be adequate when both groups
    have at least 5 observations.
<p>
    Note that the CI for a single median is obtained using a method different
    from that used by the @centile@ command, so will not be identical.
<p>
    WARNING: calculation of CIs for unpaired medians requires storage space for
    n1 * n2 observations, where n1 and n2 are the numbers in each group.  If
    you have insufficient memory, you will get an error message and a ^r(2002);
&gt; ^
    return code.
<p>
^unpaired^ indicates that the data are to be treated as unpaired.
<p>
^unequal^ indicates that the unpaired data are not to be assumed to have equal
    variances.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ defines the percent coverage for the confidence interval.

        ^$S_1^  number of observations
        ^$S_2^  degrees of freedom (not used if ^median^ is specified)
        ^$S_3^  mean or median difference, group 1 - group 2
        ^$S_4^  SEM, or K if ^median^ specified (see Gardner and Altman)
        ^$S_5^  lower confidence limit for difference
        ^$S_6^  upper confidence limit for difference
