Description
-----------
<p>
^qap^ implements the quadratic assignment procedure, a simulation-based
method for determining confidence intervals for parameter estimates
when the data set is dyadic.  It generates ^reps()^ QAP samples and
runs the user-defined program ^progname^ on each sample.
<p>
The original data set should represent a square matrix of pairwise
observations.  The full matrix or the upper or lower triangle (for symmetric
matrices) can be used.  The qap command is modelled on the
bstrap command and uses many of the same options.
<p>
The QAP sample is a transformation of the data set corresponding to
a permutation of rows and columns (with rows and columns being permuted
the same way), where ^permvars^ are assigned new row/column numbers and
all other variables are kept in the original row/column.
<p>
Each permutation sample then corresponds to the null hypothesis of no
association between ^permvars^ and the other variables, and the total QAP
sample allows estimation of confidence intervals around the parameter
estimates under the null hypothesis.
<p>
The qap program uses Stata's built-in random number generator in the
creation of the permuted samples.  To get reproducible results,
set the random-number seed by typing ^set seed^ # before running ^qap^.
see help @generate@.
<p>
<p>
Parameters
----------
<p>
^progname^ is the estimation program to be called for each QAP iteration.
This can be either a user-supplied program, or the built-in program _qap.
If progname is given as ^_qap^, the ^cmd^ and ^stats^ options are required,
and the command specified in the ^cmd^ option will be run for each sample,
with the statistics specified in the ^stats^ list saved.
<p>
^rowvar^ is a numeric variable giving the row subscript of the observation.
The rows must be numbered sequentially from 1 to N, where N is the
number of rows and columns in the matrix.
<p>
^colvar^ is a numeric variable giving the column.  The columns must be
numbered sequentially from 1 to N.
<p>
The values of ^rowvar^ and ^colvar^ must define all observations of a full
square matrix or the upper or lower triangular part.  In most applications,
the diagonal values are not used in the estimation.  For a full square
matrix, the diagonal observations must be included in the data set, and
the dependent variable should be set to missing.  (For a triangular
data set, observations on the diagonal may be included or excluded.)
<p>
^permvars^ is a list of variables that will be permuted in each sample.
All other variables will be kept with their original row and column.
Normally, permvars should contain only the dependent variable and
a weight variable, if used.
<p>
QAP Options
-----------
<p>
^reps(^#^)^ specifies the number of QAP replications to be performed.  The
    default is ^500^.
<p>
Options for the output file
---------------------------
<p>
^saving(^filename^)^ creates a Stata data file (^.dta^ file) containing the QAP
    distribution for each user-specified statistic.
<p>
^replace^ indicates that the file specified by ^saving()^ may be overwritten.
<p>
^double^ specifies that the bootstrap results for each replication are to be
    stored as ^double^s, meaning 8-byte reals.  By default, they are stored as
    ^float^s, meaning 4-byte reals.  See help @datatypes@.
<p>
^every(^#^)^ specifies that results are to be written to disk every #th replica
&gt; -
    tion.  ^every()^ should only be specified in conjunction with ^saving()^ wh
&gt; en
    performing bootstraps that take a very long time.  This will allow recovery
    of partial results should your computer crash; see help @postfile@.
<p>
^leave^ keeps the QAP sample data set in memory, overwriting the original
    data set.
<p>
Options for panel and multi-group data
--------------------------------------
<p>
^timevar^ is used for panel data.  In this case, the data set should contain
the same number of observations for each cell in the matrix, indexed by the
variable(s) in ^timevar^.  When the permutations are done, all observations
corresponding to a cell in the matrix are kept together, and sorted
by the ^timevar^ variable(s).  This preserves any autocorrelation and/or
within-cell dependence of the variables.
<p>
^groupvr^ is used for data sets containing multiple independent matrices,
possibly of different sizes.  In this case, each level of the ^groupvr^
variables should contain a complete matrix, and the type of matrix (full
matrix or upper or lower triangular) must be the same in each group.  For
data sets of this form, the matrix in each group is permuted independently.
This is not appropriate for panel data, because the permuted samples will
not contain the same dependence structure as the original data set.
<p>
Options for the estimation program
----------------------------------
<p>
^args(^...^)^ specifies any arguments to be passed to ^progname^.  The
    first query call is then of the form "progname ^?^ ..." and subsequent call
&gt; s
    of the form "progname postname ...".  This is not used by the built-in
    program _qap.
<p>
^cmd(^...^)^ specifies the estimation command to be run at each iteration
    if program _qap is used.
<p>
^stats(^statistic list^)^ specifies the names of the statistics to be
    saved if program _qap is used.  To save a coefficient estimate, use
    _b[varname].  To save other statistics, use the names in "Saved Results"
    in the Stata documentation.  E.g., for the -regress- command, the
    R-squared is saved in e(r2) and the F statistic in e(F).
<p>
^capture^ prevents program _qap from aborting if ^progname^ fails to produce
    estimates for any specified statistic in the ^stats^ list in any
    of the randomized samples.  This can be used in cases of
    data-dependent multicollinearity or convergence problems.  In this case,
    one or more of the statistics will have missing values for some samples.
<p>
Options for output/tracing/debugging
------------------------------------
<p>
^noisily^ requests that any output from ^_qap^ or the user-defined ^progname^
    and brief messages about program operation be displayed.
<p>
^dots^ requests a dot be placed on the screen at the beginning of each replica-
    tion, thus providing feedback.
<p>
^count^ displays the iteration number at the beginning of each iteration.
<p>
^debug^ displays large amounts of debugging output.
<p>
^notable^ prevents display of the detailed summary statistics for the QAP
    sample.  The actual value's percentile in the QAP distribution is
    still printed.
<p>
^nodisp^ prevents display of the actual value's percentile in the QAP
    distribution.  If both ^notable^ and ^nodisp^ are specified, there is
    no printed output, but a data set of QAP values will be created if the
    ^saving^ option is used.
<p>
Notes
-----
<p>
^progname^ must have the following outline:
<p>
        ^program define^ progname
                ^version^ #  /* version_number */
                ^if "`1'" == "?" {^
                        ^global S_1 "^variable names^"^
                        ^exit^
                ^}^
                perform calculation of statistics on data in memory
                ^post `1'^ results
        ^end^
<p>
There must be the same number of results following ^post `1'^ as variable names
following ^global S_1^.
<p>
Example of ^qap^
--------------
<p>
Assume that the data set in memory has N^^2 observations corresponding
to a square matrix of information on dyads, with variables
^rownum^ and ^colnum^ identifying the rows and columns.
It is desired to find QAP confidence intervals for the parameter estimates
and the R-square of a regression model:
<p>
        reg outcome var1 var2
<p>
The program is:
<p>
        qap _qap rownum colnum outcome, saving(qapsampl) replace /*
           */ cmd(reg outcome var1 var2) stats(_b[var1] _b[var2] e(r2))
<p>
If the original data set corresponds to a symmetric matrix, the qap
program will run more quickly if only the lower or upper triangle is
used.  E.g., prior to running ^qap^, give the command:
<p>
        drop if rownum &gt;= colnum        /* Save only upper triangle */
