<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b> 
<p>
<b>qlognorm</b> plots the quantiles of <i>varname</i> against the quantiles of the
corresponding lognormal distribution (Q-Q plot).
<p>
<b>plognorm</b> graphs a standardized lognormal probability (P-P) plot for <i>varname</i>.
<p>
The (two-parameter) lognormal distribution fitted corresponds to a normal
distribution with the mean and standard deviation of log(<i>varname</i>).
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
Sometimes there is interest in whether the lognormal is appropriate as a
distribution model for a variable. Other times there is interest in whether the
logarithm of a variable is more nearly normal than that variable itself. These
are two sides of the same question.  <b>qlognorm</b> and <b>plognorm</b> are commands for
investigating it directly.
<p>
With official Stata, it is easy to <b>generate</b> a new variable which is the
logarithm of a variable and then to use <b>qnorm</b> and <b>pnorm</b> to see whether that new
variable is close to normal in distribution. Using <b>qlognorm</b> and <b>plognorm</b>
instead has these small but distinct advantages:
<p>
    1. If you do this frequently, you will need to type less; sometimes, but
    not always, you will decide that a log transformation is advisable.
<p>
    2. Fit can be assessed graphically on both raw and transformed scales.
<p>
    3. If desired, you can use a plotting position other than the i / (N + 1)
    wired into <b>qnorm</b> and <b>pnorm</b>.
<p>
    4. If desired, you can insist on maximum likelihood estimation.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
<b>grid</b> adds grid lines at the .05, .10, .25, .50, .75, .90, and .95 quantiles
    when specified with <b>qlognorm</b>. It is equivalent to <b>yline(.25 .5 .75)</b>
    <b>xline(.25 .5 .75)</b> when specified with <b>plognorm</b>.
<p>
<i>graph_options</i> are any of the options allowed with <b>graph, twoway</b>; see help 
    grtwoway.
<p>
<b>a(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies a family of plotting positions, defined by
    (i - a) / (N - 2a + 1), where i is the rank assigned to an observed value
    and N is the number of observed values. The default is 0.5.  (Note that the
    default for <b>qnorm</b> and <b>pnorm</b> is 0.  Choice of <b>a</b> is rarely material unless
    the sample size is very small, and then the exercise is moot whatever is
    done. For more on plotting positions, see
    http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/stat/pcrank.html.
<p>
<b>ml</b> specifies maximum likelihood estimation. This option is for purists only.
    The only difference it makes is to ensure that the standard deviation of
    log(<i>varname</i>) is calculated as the root mean square deviation from the mean.
    Multiplying the default standard deviation, which is that produced by
    <b>summarize</b>, by a factor of sqrt(N / (N - 1)) is rarely material unless the
    sample size is very small, and then the exercise is moot whatever is done.
