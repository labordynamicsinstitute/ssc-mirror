Quantile-quantile plot for data vs fitted beta distribution
------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^qbeta4^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    [ ^,^ ^a^lpha^(^#^)^  ^b^eta^(^#^)^ ^gr^id graph_options ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^qbeta4^ plots the quantiles of varname against the quantiles of a
two-parameter beta distribution with shape parameters alpha and beta. By
default, alpha and beta are taken from S_2 and S_3, which is where
^beta4^ puts maximum likelihood estimates of them.
<p>
Note: this is the original version of ^qbeta^, written for Stata 4. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^qbeta^. 
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^alpha(^#^)^ sets alpha to #.
<p>
^beta(^#^)^ sets beta to #.
<p>
^grid^ adds grid lines at the .05, .10, .25, .50, .75, .90, and .95
    quantiles.
<p>
graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^; see
    help for ^graph^.

        Alan Feiveson pointed out that ^invfprob()^ could be used to
        obtain the inverse of the beta distribution function.
