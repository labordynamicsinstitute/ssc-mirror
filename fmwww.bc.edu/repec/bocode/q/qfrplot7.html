<b><u>Quantile plots of fitted and residuals</u></b> 
<p>
        <b>qfrplot7</b> [ <b>,</b> <b>super</b> <b><u>r</u></b><b>everse</b> <b>a(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> {<b><u>norm</u></b><b>al</b>|<b><u>gauss</u></b><b>ian</b>} <i>graph_options</i> ]
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>qfrplot7</b> plots quantile plots of fitted values, minus their mean, and residuals
from the previous estimation command. Fitted values are whatever <b>predict</b>
produces by default and residuals are whatever <b>predict, res</b> produces. Comparing
the distributions gives an overview of their variability and some idea of their
fine structure. By default plots are side-by-side.
<p>
The plot is restricted to the estimation sample.
<p>
This is the original of <b>qfrplot</b> for Stata 7, renamed <b>qfrplot7</b>.  Users of Stata
8 upwards should upgrade to <b>qfrplot</b>.

<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
A quantile plot shows ordered values versus the so-called plotting positions,
or if the <b>normal</b> or <b>gaussian</b> option is specified, the corresponding quantiles
of a standard normal (Gaussian) distribution.  For n values ordered minimum
first, the plotting positions are (i - a) / (n - 2a + 1) for i = 1, ..., n,
where a is by default 0.5.
<p>
W.S. Cleveland in <i>Visualizing data</i> (Hobart Press, Summit, NJ, 1993) gives many
side-by-side quantile plots of fit and residuals, which he calls "residual-fit
spread plots". See example on p.41. However, he also uses this term for
side-by-side time series plots of fit and residuals. See example on p.157. The
command name and description here emphasise the use of a quantile plot.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>super</b> specifies that plots are to be superimposed, not side-by-side.
<p>
<b>reverse</b> reverses the sort order, so that ordered values are plotted against
    1 - plotting position.
<p>
<b>a(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies a in the formula for plotting position.  The default is a = 0.5,
    giving (i - 0.5) / n. Other choices include a = 0, giving i / (n + 1), and
    a = 1/3, giving (i - 1/3) / (n + 1/3). Rarely will choice of a make any
    discernible difference.
<p>
<b>normal</b> specifies that standard normal quantiles should be shown instead of
    plotting positions. <b>gaussian</b> is an exact synonym except that by default the
    text <b>Gaussian</b> will appear within the axis title, rather than <b>normal</b>.
<p>
<i>graph_options</i> are options of <b>graph, twoway</b> except for <b>by()</b>.  Defaults include
    <b>border gap(5)</b>. If <b>symbol()</b> is specified, the first symbol is used to plot
    fitted values and the second symbol to plot residuals. Otherwise, graph
    options refer to either or both graphs produced, except that <b>saving()</b> and
    <b>title()</b> refer to the combined graph image.
