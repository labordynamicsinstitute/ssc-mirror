Description
-----------
<p>
^kwallis2^ is an extremely useful test for deciding whether k indepedent
samples are from different populations. The null hypothesis is that k samples
come from the same population or from identical populations with the same
median. When a significant value is found, ^kwallis2^ determine which groups ar
&gt; e
different.
<p>
varname refers to the variable recording the outcome and groupvar refers to the
variable denoting the population.  Note that the ^by()^ "option" is not optiona
&gt; l.
<p>
With the ^control()^ option, you may specify which group is to be considered as
a control group or a standard group. For example, when a researcher wishes to
assess the effects of various drugs on behavior.
