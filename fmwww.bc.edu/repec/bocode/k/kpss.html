    <b>kpss</b> is for use with time-series data. varname may contain time-series
    operators; <b>help varlist</b>.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before using <b>kpss</b>; see
    help <b>tsset</b>.  <b>kpss</b> supports the <b>by</b> prefix, which may be used to operate on
    each time series in a panel. Alternatively, the <b>if</b> qualifier may be used to
    specify a single time series in a panel.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>kpss</b> performs the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, Shin (KPSS, 1992) test
    for stationarity of a time series. This test differs from those "unit root"
    tests in common use (such as <b>dfuller</b>, <b>pperron</b> and <b>dfgls</b>) by having a null
    hypothesis of stationarity. The test may be conducted under the null of
    either trend stationarity (the default) or level stationarity. Inference
    from this test is complementary to that derived from those based on the
    Dickey-Fuller distribution (such as <b>dfuller</b>, <b>pperron</b> and <b>dfgls</b>). The KPSS
    test is often used in conjunction with those tests to investigate the
    possibility that a series is fractionally integrated (that is, neither I(1)
    nor I(0)):  see Lee and Schmidt (1996). As such, it is complementary to
    <b>gphudak</b>, <b>modlpr</b> and <b>roblpr</b>.
<p>
    The test's denominator--an estimate of the long-run variance of the
    timeseries, computed from the empirical autocorrelation function--may be
    calculated using either the Bartlett kernel, as employed by KPSS, or the
    Quadratic Spectral kernel. Andrews (1991) and Newey and West (1994)
    indicate that the latter kernel yields more accurate estimates of
    sigma-squared than other kernels in finite samples." (Hobijn et al., 1998,
    p.6)
<p>
    The maximum lag order for the test is by default calculated from the sample
    size using a rule provided by Schwert (1989) using <i>c</i>=12 and <i>d</i>=4 in his
    terminology. The maximum lag order may also be provided with the <b>maxlag</b>
    option, and may be zero. If the maximum lag order is at least one, the test
    is performed for each lag, with the sample size held constant over lags at
    the maximum available sample.
<p>
    Alternatively, the maximum lag order (bandwidth) may be derived from an
    automatic bandwidth selection routine, rendering it unnecessary to evaluate
    a range of test statistics for various lags. Hobijn et al. (1998) found
    that the combination of the automatic bandwidth selection option and the
    Quadratic Spectral kernel yielded the best small sample test performance in
    Monte Carlo simulations.
<p>
    Approximate critical values for the KPSS test are taken from KPSS, 1992.
<p>
    The KPSS test statistic for each lag is placed in the return array.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>maxlag(</b>#<b>)</b> specifies the maximum lag order to be used in calculating the 
test. If omitted, the maximum lag order is calculated as described above.
<p>
<b><u>not</u></b><b>rend</b> indicates that level stationarity, rather than trend stationarity,
is the null hypothesis.
<p>
<b>qs</b> specifies that the autocovariance function is to be weighted by the 
Quadratic Spectral kernel, rather than the Bartlett kernel.
<p>
<b>auto</b> specifies that the automatic bandwidth selection procedure proposed by
Newey and West (1994) as described by Hobijn et al. (1998, p.7) is used to
determine <b>maxlag</b>. In that case, a single value of the test statistic is
produced, at the optimal bandwidth.
