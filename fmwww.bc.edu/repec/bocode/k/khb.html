<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>khb</b> applies the KHB method developed to compare the estimated
    coefficients between two nested non-linear probability models
    (Karlson/Holm/Breen 2011; Breen/Karlson/Holm 2010). An important use of
    the technique is to decompose the total effect of a variable into a
    <i>direct</i> and <i>indirect</i> of <i>spurious</i> part.  The method is developed for
    binary, logit and probit models, but this command also includes other
    nonlinear probability models (ordered and multinomial) and linear
    regression. Contrary to other decomposition methods, the KHB-method gives
    unbiased decompositions, decomposes effects of both discrete and
    continuous variables, and provides analytically derived statistical tests
    for many models of the GLM family.
<p>
    In linear regression models, decomposing the total effect into direct and
    indirect/spurious effects is straightforward. The decomposition is done
    by comparing the estimated coefficient of a key variable of interest
    (<i>key-var</i>) between a <i>reduced</i> model without a control variable Z and a <i>full</i>
    model with one or more Z variable added. The difference between the
    estimated coefficients of the key-variable of interest in the two models
    expresses the amount by which the effect of the key-variable is
    confounded by the z-variable(s). If the control variable is hypothesized
    to be a consequence of the key-variable, the difference will be commonly
    termed as the "indirect effect"; if the control variable is the
    hypothesized to be a cause of the key-variable, the difference is termed
    the "spurious effect".
<p>
    The strategy described for linear models cannot be used in the context of
    nonlinear probability models such as logit and probit, because the
    estimated coefficients of these models are not comparable between
    different models. The reason is a rescaling of the model induced by a
    property of these models: the coefficients and the error variance are not
    separately identified. The KHB-method solves this problem. It allows the
    comparison of effects of nested models for many models of the GLM
    framework, including logit, probit, ologit, oprobit, and mlogit. The
    basic idea of the method is to compare the full model with a reduced
    model that substitutes some Z-variables by the residuals of the
    Z-variables from a regression of the Z-variables on the <i>key-vars</i> (see
    Karlson/Holm/Breen 2011 for explanations and details). The method
    consequently allows separation of the change in the coefficient that is
    due to confounding and the change that is due to rescaling.
<p>
    The KHB-method also allows the inclusion variables that control for
    confounding influences on the decomposition. These variables are named
    concomitants in Karlson/Holm (2011) and Breen/Karlson/Holm (2010). These
    variables do not play the role of the Z-variables of the
    y*-x-relationship, but rather as a set of variables that is included to
    secure that both, the effects of the full model and the reduced model are
    not confounded by these variables.
<p>
    The KHB-method is primarily intended to be used for various variants of
    logit and probit models. However, it can be also used for linear
    regression, in which case it returns the same results as the standard
    technique. <b>khb</b> is then just a convenient way to do the decomposition with
    one single command.
<p>
    Note that using regress as <i>model-type</i> for binary dependent variables
    boils down to using a linear probability model for the decomposition.
    However, the interpretation of decompositions in linear probability
    models is unknown, and may not reflect the parameters of interest (in
    particular the indirect effect). Caution should consequently be
    exercised, and the authors do not recommend using khb for linear
    probability models until the properties of these models have been
    explored formally.
<p>
    A worked example using <b>khb</b> appears in Breen/Karlson/Holm (2010).
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>s</u></b><b>ummary</b> requests the provision of a decomposition summary for all
        <i>key-vars</i>. By default, <b>khb</b> reports the effects of all key variables
        along with standard errors in terms of the estimated coefficients.
        With option summary, <b>khb</b> also presents a table holding the
        "confounding ratios", the "percentage reduction due to confounding"
        and the "rescale factor". The confounding ratio measures the impact
        of confounding net of rescaling. The percentage reduction measures
        the percentage change in the coefficient of each <i>key-var</i> attributable
        to confounding net of scaling. Finally, the rescale factor measures
        the impact of rescaling, net of confounding.
<p>
    <b><u>d</u></b><b>isentangle</b> request a table that show how much of the difference between
        the full and reduced model is contributed by each of the single
        z-variables.
<p>
    <b><u>not</u></b><b>able</b> suppresses the display of the coefficient table. This normally
        involves the options <b>summarize</b> and/or <b>disentangle</b>
<p>
    <b><u>c</u></b><b>oncomitant(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b> is used to specify control variables that are not
        z-variables. Factor variables are allowed.
<p>
    <b>vce(</b><i>vcetype</i><b>)</b> specifies the type of standard error reported. It defaults
        to the Stata's defaults for the specified model-type. Standard errors
        for indirect effects are estimated using a method discussed by Sobel
        (1982). The option vce() set the standard errors for total and direct
        effects and controls the type of standard error that enter into
        Sobel's method. Types <b>robust</b>, <b>cluster</b>; see help vce_option.
<p>
    <b>ape</b> is used to decompose the <i>key-vars</i> using average partial effects
        (average marginal effects). Uses margins to compute average partial
        effects. For <i>model-types</i> ologit and oprobit, khb uses the average
        partial effect on the probability for the first outcome unless
        <b>outcome()</b> is specified; see ologit_postestimation for various ways to
        specify <b>outcome()</b>. Note that with APE the calculated indirect effect
        is not constant across outcomes. This is a well-known property of
        ordered choice models (see Greene/Henscher 2010).
<p>
    <b>or</b> exponentiates the estimated coefficients, and hence shows odds-ratios
        for logit models. The coefficient for the reduced model is then the
        product of the full model with the estimated difference.
<p>
    <b><u>v</u></b><b>erbose</b> is used to show the complete output of the full and restricted
        models that are used to estimate the decomposition. This is
        especially usefull to detect problems that occure in the intermediate
        steps of the estimation.
<p>
    <b><u>k</u></b><b>eep</b> is used to keep the residuals of the z-variables, i.e. the
        z-variables net of confounding. These residuals are included as
        independent variables in the reduced model.
<p>
    <b>continuous</b> Average partial effects are by default based on unit effects
        for dummy variables. Specifying continuous treats dummy variables
        equal to continuous variables. See margins for details about this
        option
<p>
    <b><u>xs</u></b><b>tandard</b> is used to standardize the <i>key-vars</i>.
<p>
    <b><u>zs</u></b><b>tandard</b> is used to standardize the <i>z-vars</i>.
<p>
    <b><u>out</u></b><b>come(</b><i>outcome</i><b>)</b> specifies the outcome for which the decompostion is to
        be calculated. This takes effect for models for multinomial response
        (mlogit), and, if option <b>ape</b> is specified, for ordered response
        models. <b>outcome()</b> can be specified using
<p>
            <b>#1</b>, <b>#2</b>, ..., where <b>#1</b> means the first category of the dependent
            variable, <b>#2</b> means the second category, etc.;
<p>
            the values of the dependent variable; or
<p>
            the value labels of the dependent variable if they exist.
<p>
    <b><u>b</u></b><b>aseoutcome(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> can be used for <i>model-type</i> <b>mlogit</b>.  It specifies the value
        of depvar to be treated as the base outcome. The default is to choose
        the most frequent outcome. The option can be used together with
        <b>outcome()</b> to fully control the contrast for which the decompositon is
        done.
