d 'KAPGOF': module to compute confidence intervals for the kappa statisticdd kapgof computes confidence intervals for the kappa statistic	ford two indepedent raters and a binary outcome. These confidenced intervals for kappa have desirable small-sample properties. Itd also computes confidence intervals for agreement. This confidenced interval is not conditional on kappa being zero or ad pre-specified non-null kappa, as some other procedures are. dd Distribution-Date: 20020830dd Author: Jan Brogger, University of Bergen, Norwayd Support: email jan.brogger@@med.uib.nodf kapgof.adof kapgof.hlp
