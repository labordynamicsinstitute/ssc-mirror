Usage
-----
        ^kapgof^ varlist, [level(real 0.05) kappa_options]
<p>
Description
-----------
^kapgof^ computes confidence intervals for the kappa statistic 
for two indepedent raters and a binary outcome. These confidence
intervals for kappa have desirable small-sample properties. It
also computes confidence intervals for agreement.
<p>
This confidence interval is not conditional on kappa being zero
or a pre-specified non-null kappa, as some other procedures are.
<p>
<p>
It calls @kap@ and returns the same values as this. Although
values for the standard error and z-score are returned, they
are not printed. Presumably, they wouldn't be as useful as
confidence intervals.
<p>
Examples
-----------
  .^kapgof^ astma1 astma2
<p>
computes the kappa statistic and confidence intervals

Remarks
-------
Bloch &amp; Kraemer (1989) suggest an arcsine transformation. Donner
&amp; Eliasziw (1992) compare this with the goodness-of fit approach
and find that the GOF approach gives coverage levels that are
closer to nominal, even in small samples down to as little
as n=25. I am not aware of any implementations of this arcsine
transformation in any widely available computer program.
<p>
The confidence interval given in Fleiss (1981) p.221 is for 
a pre-specified non-null kappa.
<p>
The confidence intervals for agreement are computed, but
not printed at present. Use ^return list^ to see the
results. They are simply a binomial confidence interval
for the number of agreeing cells as a binomial trial out
of the total number of tries, e.g. (a+b) out of N trials.
