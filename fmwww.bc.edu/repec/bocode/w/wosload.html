Description
-----------
<p>
^wosload^
Loads textfiles from Web of Science (Wos).  Downloaded 
files from from WoS are saved as "Full record" (with or 
without Cited References) to "Tab-delimited (Win)"-files. 
^wosload^ imports the address fields in multiple variables, 
so that the address field has no limit on its length. 
All other fields are limited  to Stata's standard 
244 character length. Variables that go beyond 244 
characters, for example the abstract variable,will be
truncated. Variables are labeled in accordance with the
definitions provided by Thompson Reuters available here:

<p>
Before textfiles from Wos can be loaded by Stata hey
need to be converted from UTF-16 text format. Open the text
file using a text editor and save it in a format other than
UTF-16. Only then can the files can be used by ^wosload^.
