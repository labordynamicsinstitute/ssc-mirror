{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:wgtdistrim} trims extreme sampling weights 
using the weight distribution approach suggested by Potter (1990).

{pstd}
The reciprocal of the sampling weights are assumed to follow a (scaled) 
{help ibeta:beta} distribution. 
The parameters of the beta distribution are estimated from the sampling weights 
and the trimming levels (cut-offs) are computed for the specified percentiles. 
Sampling weights that are more extreme than the specified percentiles 
are trimmed to these percentiles and the excess is distributed equally 
among the untrimmed sampling weights 
so that the sum of the trimmed sampling weights 
equals the sum of the untrimmed sampling weights. 
This process is repeated a specified number of times 
(or until the trimmed sampling weights do no longer change)
to otain the final trimmed sampling weights.

{title:Options}

{phang}
{cmd:generate(}[{help datatypes:{it:type}}] {newvar}{cmd:)}
specifies the name and, optionally, the type of the new variable 
containing the trimmed sampling weights.
Option {opt generate()} is required.

{phang}
{opt upper(#)}
specifies the probability of occurrence 
of large sampling weights to be trimmed. 
Large sampling weights with probability of occurence 
less than {it:#}, where 0 < {it:#} < 1, are trimmed
to the 1-{it:#} percentile of the beta distribution.
Option {opt upper()} is required.

{phang}
{opt lower(#)}
specifies the probability of occurrence 
of small sampling weights to be trimmed. 
Small sampling weights with probability of occurence 
less than {it:#}, where 0 < {it:#} < 1, are trimmed
to the {it:#} percentile of the beta distribution.
Default is {cmd:lower(0)}.

{phang}
{opt iterate(#)}
specifies the maximum number of iterations, 
i.e., how often the trimming levels are computed. 
The default maximum number of iterations is 10.

{phang}
{opt tolerance(#)}
specifies the tolerance for trimmed sampling weights.
When the relative difference in sampling weights 
from one iteration to the next is less than or equal to {it:#}, 
convergence is achieved. 
The default {opt tolerance()} is 0.

{phang}
{opt normalize}
specifies that the trimmed sampling weights be normalized 
to sum to the number of observations 
(with non-missing positive sampling weights).
Normalization is done once, after the trimming procedure.


{...}
{...}
{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
Trim sampling weights only on the right tail of the beta distribution
if the probability of occurence is less than 0.01 (1 percent).

{phang2}
{cmd:. wgtdistrim pweight , generate(double pweight_trimmed) upper(.01)}
{p_end}

{pstd}
Trim sampling weights on the left and right tail of the beta distribution
if the probability of occurence is less than 0.01 (1 percent) on either tail. 

{phang2}
{cmd:. wgtdistrim pweight , generate(double pweight_trimmed) lower(.01) upper(.01)}
{p_end}

{pstd}
Same as above, but also normalize the the trimmed sampling 
weights to sum to the number of observations.

{phang2}
{cmd:. wgtdistrim pweight , generate(double pweight_trimmed) lower(.01) upper(.01) normalize}
