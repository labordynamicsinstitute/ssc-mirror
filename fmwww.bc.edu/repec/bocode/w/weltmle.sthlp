{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2 120}
{hi: Modern Epidemiology} has been able to identify significant limitations of classic epidemiological methods, like outcome regression analysis, when estimating causal quantities such as the average treatment effect (ATE) 
for observational data. For example, using classical regression models to estimate the ATE requires making the assumption that the effect measure is constant across levels of confounders included in the model,
 i.e. that there is no effect modification. Other methods do not require this assumption, including g-methods (e.g. the {hi:g-formula}) and targeted maximum likelihood estimation ({hi:TMLE}).
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2 120}
The average treatment effect ({hi:ATE}) or risk difference is the most commonly used causal parameter. Many estimators of the ATE but no all rely on parametric modeling assumptions. Therefore, the correct model specification is crucial 
to obtain unbiased estimates of the true ATE.
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2 120}
TMLE is a semiparametric, efficient substitution estimator allowing for data-adaptive estimation while obtaining valid statistical inference based on the targeted minimum loss-based estimation. TMLE has the advantage of 
being doubly robust. Moreover, TMLE allows inclusion of {hi:machine learning} algorithms to minimise the risk of model misspecification, a problem that persists for competing estimators. Evidence shows that TMLE typically 
provides the {hi: least unbiased} estimates of the ATE compared with other double robust estimators.

{p_end}

{p 4 4 2 120}
{hi:eltmle} is a Stata program implementing the targeted maximum likelihood estimation for the ATE for a binary or continuous outcome and binary treatment. {hi:eltmle} includes the use of a super-learner called from the {hi:SuperLearner}
package v.2.0-21 (Polley E., et al. 2011). The Super-Learner uses V-fold cross-validation (10-fold by default) to assess the performance of prediction regarding the potential outcomes and the propensity score as weighted 
averages of a set of machine learning algorithms. We used the default SuperLearner algorithms implemented in the base installation of the {hi:tmle-R} package v.1.2.0-5 (Susan G. and Van der Laan M., 2017), 
which included the following: i) stepwise selection, ii) generalized linear modeling (GLM), iii) a GLM variant that includes second order polynomials and two-by-two interactions of the main terms
included in the model. Additionally, {hi:eltmle} users will have the option to include Bayes Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models as additional Super-Learner algorithms. Future implementations will offer 
more advanced machine learning algorithms. 
{p_end}

{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2 120}
{hi:tmle}: this is the default option. If no-option is specified eltmle by default implements the
TMLE algorithm plus the super-Learner ensemble learning for the main three machine learning algorithms described above.
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2 120}
{hi:tmlebgam}: this option may be specified or unspecified. When specified, it does include in addition to the above default
implementation, the Bayes Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models as Super-Learner algorithms for the tmle estimator.
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2 120}
{hi:slaipw}: this option may be specified or unspecified. When specified, it does estimate the augmented
inverse probability weighting algorithm plus the Super Learner ensemble learning for the main three machine 
learning algorithms described above.
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2 120}
{hi:slaipwbgam}: this option may be specified or unspecified. When specified, it does include in addition to the above default
implementation, the Bayes Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models as Super-Learner algorithms for the slaipw estimator.
