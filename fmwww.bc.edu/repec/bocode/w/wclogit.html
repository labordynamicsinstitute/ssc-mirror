<b><u>Conditional logistic regression with within-group varying weights</u></b>
<p>
        <b>wclogit</b> [<i>varlist</i>] [<b>using</b>] [<b>if</b><i> exp</i>] [<b>in</b><i> exp</i>] [{help:weight}<i> exp</i>] ,
                           <b><u>g</u></b><b>roup(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> [ <b><u>l</u></b><b>evel(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> <b>or</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
This command maximises the partial log-likelihood for conditional logistic
regression with weights that can vary within the matched set defined by the
<b>group</b> option. In calculations the Breslow likelihood as specified in the STATA
manual. Note that only one case is allowed within one group so no ties are
possible and that frequency weights are not allowed.  In other words the
dataset should be expanded to an "individual data" format.
<p>
The main application for this function would be when you have inverse
probability weights to correct for any bias introduced in selecting members of
each group. A typical epidemiological design would be the case-cohort study
where every case from a larger cohort is included in the analysis but a smaller
random sample of all possible controls are included.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b><u>g</u></b><b>roup(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> is not optional; it specifies the identifier variable (numeric
    or string) for the matched groups.
<p>
<b><u>l</u></b><b>evel(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the confidence level, in percent, for the confidence
    intervals of the coefficients; see help level.
<p>
<b>or</b> reports the estimated coefficients transformed to odds ratios, i.e., exp(b)
    rather than b.  Standard errors and confidence intervals are similarly
    transformed.  This option affects how results are displayed, not how they
    are estimated.<b>  or</b> may be specified at estimation or when redisplaying
    previously estimated results.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
To analyse an "enriched" matched case control study using inverse probability
weights specified in the variable <b>ipw</b>.
<p>
 .wclogit case exp [aw=ipw], or level(99) group(matchedset)
<p>
Although in this example the option used "analytical weights" [aw=ipw] it is
because these seemed more natural for this command. Inverse probability weights
are definitely not frequency or probability weights.
