{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:wtdttt} estimates a parametric Waiting Time Distribution (WTD)
to {varname} and then computes an estimate of the specified percentile
together with an estimate of the proportion of prevalent users in the
sample. Parameters may depend on covariates when estimating a reverse
WTD.

{pstd}
{bf: Note:} To use this command you first need to create a dataset
which contains only the first prescription redemption of each
individual within an observation window (ordinary WTD), or the last
(reverse WTD), respectively. You can typically achieve
this with something like the following two lines of code:

{phang2}{cmd: . keep if rxdate >= startdate & rxdate <= enddate}

{phang2}{cmd: . bysort pid (rxdate): keep if _n == 1}

{pstd} or for the reverse WTD replace the last line with

{phang2}{cmd: . bysort pid (rxdate): keep if _n == _N}

{pstd} Here {cmd: pid} is a variable containing a person identifier
and {cmd: rxdate} is a variable containing the time of observed
prescription redemptions, typically dates.

{pstd} To assess the fit, the command {help wtdtttdiag} can be used to
obtain diagnostic plots.

{pstd} After estimation, the command {help wtdtttprob} allows prediction
of treatment probabilities on dates of interest based on observed
prescription redemptions.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Recurrence distribution}

{phang} 
{opt disttype} specifies the forward recurrence density to use.
Possible choices are named after their corresponding interarrival
density and there are three different choices implemented: {cmd:exp}
means Exponential, {cmd:lnorm} means Log-Normal, and {cmd:wei} means
Weibull. See Remarks below for a description of these and their
parametrization.

{dlgtab:Time window}
{phang}
{opt reverse} indicates that observations represent the last
prescription redemption observed in the interval for each patient and
a reverse WTD is estimated. If not specified (default), observations
are assumed to be first prescription redemptions and the ordinary WTD
is estimated.

{phang}
{opt start} is a string such as "1Jan2014" which gives the start date
of the observation window. Strings must conform to requirements for
the date function {help td}(). When specified an end date must also be
given. Default time for start of time window is 0. When specified, an
end date must also be given. 

{phang}
{opt end} is a string such as "31dec2014" which gives the end date
of the observation window. Strings must conform to requirements for
the date function {help td}(). When specified, a start date must also be
given.

{phang} {opt delta} specifies the length of the observation. If
specified no start and end date can be stated. Default value is 1.

{dlgtab:Covariates}
{phang}
{opt logitp:covar}({help fvvarlist}) specifies covariates included in
the regression equation for the parameter logit({it:p}) (log-odds of
prevalence).

{phang}
{opt mu:covar}({help fvvarlist}) specifies covariates included in the
regression equation for {it:mu}, when using a Log-Normal recurrence
distribution (lnorm).

{phang}
{opt lnsigma:covar}({help fvvarlist}) Covariates for log({it:sigma}) (lnorm)

{phang}
{opt lnbeta:covar}({help fvvarlist}) Covariates for log({it:beta}) (exp | wei)

{phang}
{opt lnalpha:covar}({help fvvarlist}) Covariates for log({it:alpha}) (exp | wei)

{phang}
{opt all:covar}({help fvvarlist}) Covariates included in all regression
equations for the parameters.



{phang}
{opt iadpercentile} The percentile of the IAD, which is to be
estimated specified as a fraction between 0 and 1 (default is 0.8).



{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks - Methods and Formulas}

{pstd}
The WTD is parametrized as a two-component mixture distribution with
one density component for prevalent users, {it:g(t)}, and a uniform
distribution over the observation window for incident users, i.e. the
likelihood contribution for one patient is:

{p 24 24 2}
{it:l(t) = p * g(t) + (1 - p) / delta}

{pstd} where {it: p} is the proportion of prevalent users in the
sample, and {it: delta} is the width of the observation window. Only
patients with at least one prescription redemption in the observation
window are considered. When a reverse WTD is estimated, {it:t} is time
from last prescription in the time window to its end.

{pstd} The density {it:g(t)} is known as the forward (ordinary WTD) or
backward (reverse WTD) recurrence density corresponding to the
interarrival density, {it:f(t)}, which governs the distribution of
time from one prescription redemption of a patient to the subsequent
one. {it: g(t)} is given by


{p 24 24 2}
{it:g(t)} = {it:(1 - F(t)) / M}

{pstd} where {it:F(t)} is the cumulative distribution function for
{it:f(t)} and {it:M} is the mean for {it:f(t)}. 
{* Parametrizations!!!}

{pstd}
The actual parametrizations used are:

{pstd} {bf:Exponenential}:

{p 16 24 2} {it:f(t) = exp(-(exp(lnbeta) * t))}

{p 8 12 2} where {it:lnbeta = ln(beta)}.

{pstd} {bf:Weibull}:

{p 16 24 2} {it:f(t) = exp(-(exp(lnbeta) * t) ^exp(lnalpha))}

{p 8 12 2} where {it:lnalpha = ln(alpha)} and {it:lnbeta = ln(beta)}.

{pstd} {bf:Log-Normal}:

{p 16 24 2} {it:f(t) = normprob(-(ln(x) - mu)/exp(lnsigma)) }

{p 8 12 2} where {it:lnsigma = ln(sigma)}.

{pstd} The ML procedure reports estimates of {it:lnbeta}
(Exponential), {it:(lnalpha, lnbeta)} (Weibull) or {it:(mu, lnsigma)}
(Log-Normal) together with an estimate of the log-odds of prevalent
users {it:logitp}. The latter is also reported as the estimated proportion
of prevalent users in the sample after an
inverse-logit-transformation, i.e. {it: exp(logitp)/(1 + exp(logitp))}
accompanied by a 95% confidence interval.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{phang}
{cmd:. wtdttt rx1time, disttype(lnorm) iadpercentile(0.8)}{p_end}

{pstd}
To get bootstrap confidence intervals we can do the following - notice
the use of {cmd:eform} in the second statement to obtain the
percentile itself and not its logarithm:

{phang}{cmd:. bootstrap logtimeperc = r(logtimeperc), reps(50): ///}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:wtdttt rx1time, disttype(lnorm) iadpercentile(0.8)}{p_end}

{phang}{cmd:. bootstrap, eform}

{pstd}
Further examples are provided in the example do-file
{it:wtdttt_ex.do}, which contains analyses based on the datafile
{it:wtddat.dta} - a simulated dataset, which is also enclosed.
