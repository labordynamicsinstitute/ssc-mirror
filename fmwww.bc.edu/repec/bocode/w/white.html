Description
- -----------
<p>
^htest^, ^szroeter^, and ^white^ provide tests for the assumption of 
the linear regression model that the residuals e are homoscedastic, 
i.e., have constant variance. The tests differ with respect to the 
specification of residual variances under the alternative hypothesis.
<p>
   ^white^ considers the general (unrestricted) alternative hypothesis 
in    which no assumptions is made on the residual variances (White 
1980).
<p>
   ^szroeter^ considers the alternative hypothesis that the residual 
variances    are monotonically increasing in some variable (Szroeter 
1978).
<p>
   ^htest^ performs standard score tests for H: b=0 for two parametric 
forms of    heteroscedasticity:
<p>
       ^multiplicative heteroscedastcity^ (Cook &amp; Weinberg 1983)
<p>
           var(y) = s^^2 * exp( b1.z1 + b2.z2 + .. + bk.zk)
<p>
       ^random coefficient heteroscedasticity^ (REF)    
<p>
           var(y) = s^^2 + b1.z1^^2 + b2.z2^^2 + .. + bk.zk^^2
<p>
   If no varlist is specified, ^htest^ uses the fitted values of the 
regression.
<p>
<p>
^szoeter^ and ^htest^ test homoscedasticity against specific models 
(monotonicity; multiplicative and random coefficient heteroscedasticty) 
under the alternative hypothesis. Due to the general structure of the 
alternative, ^white^ is not very powerfull against any particular form 
of heteroscedasticity.    
     Options (^htest^)
- -------
<p>
^rhs^ specifies that the independent variables of the ^fit^ted 
regression     should be used.
<p>
^univar^ specifies that univariate score tests for each of the 
variables is     displayed in addition to the "combined" test.
<p>
If ^htest^ suggest multiplicative forms of heteroscedasticity, 
regression models can be estimated using ^regmh^ or ^regmhv^ . The 
random coefficient model is currently not supported.
<p>
<p>
Options (^white^)
- -------
<p>
^preserve^ specifies that the ^white^ may ^preserve^ the data in memory 
and     drop all variables and cases that are not needed in the 
calculations. This     is costly for large data sets. However, ^white^ 
has to generate k(k+1)/2     temporary variables, where k = #rhs-vars 
in the ^fit^ted model. 
<p>
<p>
Examples
- --------
 
    . ^fit income edu sex exp exp2 industry^             (fit a 
regression model)
<p>
    . ^white^                                   
<p>
    . ^szroeter edu^                                 (variance 
increases in edu?)
<p>
    . ^htest^                                 (homoscedasticity in 
fitted values)     . ^htest edu sex exp exp2 industry^            
(homoscedasticity in rhs-vars)     . ^htest, rhs^                       
(shorthand for the previous command)     . ^htest edu exp age, univar^  
(display univariate tests as well)

Details (^white^)
- -------
<p>
White (1980) noted that the classical estimate 
<p>
        Vc = s^2 inv(X'X)
<p>
of the variance V of OLS regression estimates and the 
Huber/White/robust estimate 
<p>
        Vr = X' inv(sum e_i^2 x_i x_i') X
<p>
of V are likely to be close under homoscedasticity. White (1980) 
proposed a Hausmann-type test of the matrix difference Vc-Vr as a test 
for homoscedasticy against general forms of heteroscedasticity. 
(Actually, White showed that Vc and Vr may also be close under 
particular forms of hetero-scedasticty as well. See White (1980) for 
details.)
<p>
<p>
Details (^szroeter^)
- -------
<p>
Szoeter's class of tests for homoscedasticity against the alternative 
that the residual variance increases in some variable x are defined in 
terms of
<p>
          sum_i h(x(i)) e(i)^^2
     H =  --------------------          i=1..n
             sum_i e(i)^^2 
<p>
where h(x) is some weight function that increases in x. Note that H can 
be interpreted as a weighted avarege of the h(x), weighted by the 
squares residuals. Under homoscedasticty, H should be approximately 
equal to the unweighted average of h(x). Large values of H suggest that 
e(i)^^2 tends to be large where h(x) is large, i.e., the variance 
indeed increases in x, while small values of H suggest that the 
variance actually decreases in x.
<p>
King (1982) suggest to use h(x(i)) = rank(x(i) in x(1)..x(n)). 
The Q-statistic displayed by ^szroeter^ is a transformation of H that 
is asymptotically standard normal distributed under homoscedasticity.
<p>
^szroeter^ displays a Q-statistic (Judge 1985:452). Under 
homoscedasticity, Q is approximately N(0,1) distributed. Q&gt;2 suggests 
that the residual variance increases in varname, while Q&lt;-2 suggests 
that it decreases in varname.
