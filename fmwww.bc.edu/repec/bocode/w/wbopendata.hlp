{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:wbopendata} allows Stata users to download over 7,000 thousand indicators from the World Bank databases, including: Development 
Africa Development Indicators; Doing Business; Education Statistics; Enterprise Surveys; Global Development Finance; 
Gender Statistics; Health Nutrition and Population Statistics; International Development Association - Results Measurement System; 
Millennium Development Goals; World Development Indicators; Worldwide Governance Indicators. These indicators include information 
from over 256 countries and regions, since 1960.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}Users can chose from one of three of the {cmd:languages} supported by the database (and Stata), namely, English, Spanish, or French.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}Five possible downloads options are currently supported:{p_end}

{p 8 4 2}{cmd:country} - 1,076  indicators for all selected years for a single country (WDI Catalogue: 1,076 series).{p_end}
{p 8 4 2}{cmd:topic} - WDI indicators within a specific topic, for all selected years and all countries (WDI Catalogue: 1,076 series).{p_end}
{p 8 4 2}{cmd:indicator} - all selected years for all countries for a single indicator (from any of the catalogues: 7,349 series).{p_end}
{p 8 4 2}{cmd:indicator} and {cmd:country}  - all selected years for selected countries for a single indicator (from any of the catalogues: 5,067 series).{p_end}
{p 8 4 2}multiple {cmd:indicator} - all selected years for selected indicators separated by ; (from any of the catalogues: 7,349 series).{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}Users can also choose to have the data displayed in either the {cmd:wide} or {cmd:long} format (wide is the default option).
Note that the reshape is the local machine, so it will require the appropriate amount of RAM to work properly.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:wbopendata} draws from the main  World Bank collections of development indicators, compiled from
officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development
data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}The access to this databases is made possible by the {it:World Bank's Open Data Initiative} which provide 
open full access to {browse "http://data.worldbank.org/" : World Bank databases}.{p_end}

{title:WARNING}

{p 4 4 2}Users should not use {cmd:wbopendata} without checking first for more detailed information on the 
definitions of each {browse "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/":indicator} 
and {browse "http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/":data-catalogues} . The indicators names and codes used 
by {cmd:wbopendata} are precisely the same used in the World Bank data catalogue in order to facilitate such 
cross reference.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}When downloading specific series, through the indicator options, {cmd:wbopendata} will by default display in the Stata results window the metadata available for this 
particular series, including information on the name of the series, the source, a detailed description of the indicator, and the organization 
responsible for compiling this indicator.{p_end}

{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:long} imports the data in the long format. The default option is to import the data in the wide format. It is important 
note that {cmd:wbopendata} uses Stata resources to reshape the variables, hence user has to make sure that Stata will have sufficient 
RAM to complete this operation.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:clear} replace data in memory.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:latest} keep only the latest available value of a a single indicator (it only work if the data in the long format).{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:nometadata} omits the display of the metadata information from the series. Metadata information is only available when downloading 
specific series (indicator option). The metadata available include information on the name of the series, the source, a detailed description 
of the indicator, and the organization responsible for compiling this indicator.{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:topics}{cmd:(}{it:topics}{cmd:)} - list of topic codes (WDI series only).{p_end}

            {p 8 4 4} 1 - Agriculture & Rural Development - For the 70 percent of the world's poor who live in rural areas, agriculture is 
            the main source of income and employment. But depletion and degradation of land and water pose serious challenges to producing 
            enough food and other agricultural products to sustain livelihoods here and meet the needs of urban populations. Data presented 
            here include measures of agricultural inputs, outputs, and productivity compiled by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 2 - Aid Effectiveness - Aid effectiveness is the impact that aid has in reducing poverty and inequality, increasing growth, 
            building capacity, and accelerating achievement of the Millennium Development Goals set by the international community. Indicators here 
            cover aid received as well as progress in reducing poverty and improving education, health, and other measures of human welfare.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 3 - Economic Policy and External Debt - Economic indicators measure outcomes in the structure and rates of change of output, 
            trade, and aggregate demand, and in macroeconomic performance. The data here consist of national accounts, government finances, money 
            supply, prices, balance of payments, and external debt. Data are gathered from national statistical organizations and central banks by 
            World Bank missions and from the International Monetary Fund's data files.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 4 - Education - Education is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality and lays a foundation 
            for sustained economic growth. The World Bank compiles data on education inputs, participation, efficiency, and outcomes. Data on education 
            are compiled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics from official responses 
            to surveys and from reports provided by education authorities in each country.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 5 - Energy & Mining - The world economy needs ever-increasing amounts of energy to sustain economic growth, raise living standards, 
            and reduce poverty. But today's trends in energy use are not sustainable. As the world's population grows and economies become more industrialized, 
            nonrenewable energy sources will become scarcer and more costly. Data here on energy production, use, dependency, and efficiency are compiled 
            by the World Bank from the International Energy Agency and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 6 - Environment - Natural and man-made environmental resources - fresh water, clean air, forests, grasslands, marine resources, 
            and agro-ecosystems - provide sustenance and a foundation for social and economic development.  The need to safeguard these resources 
            crosses all borders.  Today, the World Bank is one of the key promoters and financiers of environmental upgrading in the developing world. 
            Data here cover forests, biodiversity, emissions, and pollution. Other indicators relevant to the environment are found under data pages for 
            Agriculture & Rural Development, Energy & Mining, Infrastructure, and Urban Development.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 7 - Financial Sector - An economy's financial markets are critical to its overall development. Banking systems and stock markets 
            enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction. Strong financial systems provide reliable and accessible information that lowers 
            transaction costs, which in turn bolsters resource allocation and economic growth. Indicators here include the size and liquidity of 
            stock markets; the accessibility, stability, and efficiency of financial systems; and international migration and workers' remittances, 
            which affect growth and social welfare in both sending and receiving countries.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 8 - Health - Improving health is central to the Millennium Development Goals, and the public sector is the main provider of 
            health care in developing countries. To reduce inequities, many countries have emphasized primary health care, including immunization, 
            sanitation, access to safe drinking water, and safe motherhood initiatives.  Data here cover health systems, disease prevention, reproductive 
            health, nutrition, and population dynamics. Data are from the United Nations Population Division, World Health Organization, United Nations 
            Children's Fund, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, and various other sources.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 9 - Infrastructure - Infrastructure helps determine the success of manufacturing and agricultural activities. Investments 
            in water, sanitation, energy, housing, and transport also improve lives and help reduce poverty. And new information and communication 
            technologies promote growth, improve delivery of health and other services, expand the reach of education, and support social and 
            cultural advances. Data here are compiled from such sources as the International Road Federation, Containerisation International, 
            the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Energy Association, and the International Telecommunications Union.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 10 - Labor & Social Protection - The supply of labor available in an economy includes people who are employed, those who 
            are unemployed but seeking work, and first-time job-seekers. Not everyone who works is included: unpaid workers, family workers, 
            and students are often omitted, while some countries do not count members of the armed forces. Data on labor and employment are 
            compiled by the International Labour Organization (ILO) from labor force surveys, censuses, establishment censuses and surveys, 
            and administrative records such as employment exchange registers and unemployment insurance schemes.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 11 - Poverty - The World Bank periodically prepares poverty assessments of countries in which it has an active program, in 
            close collaboration with national institutions, other development agencies, and civil society, including poor people's organizations. 
            Assessments report the extent and causes of poverty and propose strategies to reduce it. Countries have varying definitions of poverty, 
            and comparisons can be difficult. National poverty lines tend to have higher purchasing power in rich countries, where standards used 
            are more generous than in poor countries. Poverty measures based on an international poverty line attempt to hold the real value of the 
            poverty line constant across countries, including when making comparisons over time.  Data here includes measures of population living 
            below the national poverty line as well as the international poverty line. Also included are income distributions and urban and rural 
            poverty rates.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 12 - Private Sector - Private markets drive economic growth, tapping initiative and investment to create productive jobs 
            and raise incomes. Trade is also a driver of economic growth as it integrates developing countries into the world economy and generates 
            benefits for their people.  Data on the private sector and trade are from the World Bank Group's Private Participation in Infrastructure 
            Project Database, Enterprise Surveys, and Doing Business Indicators, as well as from the International Monetary Fund's Balance of 
            Payments database and International Financial Statistics, the UN Commission on Trade and Development, the World Trade Organization, 
            and various other sources.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 13 - Public Sector - Effective governments improve people's standard of living by ensuring access to essential services -  
            health, education, water and sanitation, electricity, transport - and the opportunity to live and work in peace and security. Data 
            here includes World Bank staff assessments of country performance in economic management, structural policies, policies for social 
            inclusion and equity, and public sector management and institutions for the poorest countries. Also included are indicators on 
            revenues and expenses from the International Monetary Fund's Government Finance Statistics, and on tax policies from various 
            sources.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 14 - Science & Technology - Technological innovation, often fueled by governments, drives industrial growth and helps 
            raise living standards. Data here aims to shed light on countries technology base: research and development, scientific and technical 
            journal articles, high-technology exports, royalty and license fees, and patents and trademarks. Sources include the UNESCO Institute 
            for Statistics, the U.S. National Science Board, the UN Statistics Division, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Intellectual 
            Property Organization.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 15 - Social Development - Data here cover child labor, gender issues, refugees, and asylum seekers. Children in many countries 
            work long hours, often combining studying with work for pay. The data on their paid work are from household surveys conducted by the 
            International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and national statistical offices. 
            Gender disparities are measured using a compilation of data on key topics such as education, health, labor force participation, 
            and political participation.  Data on refugees are from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees complemented by statistics 
            on Palestinian refugees under the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.{p_end}
            
            {p 8 4 4} 16 - Urban Development - Cities can be tremendously efficient. It is easier to provide water and sanitation to people 
            living closer together, while access to health, education, and other social and cultural services is also much more readily 
            available. However, as cities grow, the cost of meeting basic needs increases, as does the strain on the environment and natural 
            resources. Data on urbanization, traffic and congestion, and air pollution are from the United Nations Population Division, World 
            Health Organization, International Road Federation, World Resources Institute, and other sources.{p_end}
