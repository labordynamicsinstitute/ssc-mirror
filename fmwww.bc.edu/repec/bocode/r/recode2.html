^recode2^
<p>
^recode2^ is a frontend for the @recode@ command. It allows a varlist and can
recode into a list of new variables. It is also compatible with the syntax
of the SPSS recode command.
<p>
^Syntax^
<p>
^recode2^ varlist [:] rules [ &gt; newvarlist ]
<p>
The rules have the same syntax as @recode@. Optionally, elements may be
placed in parentheses and commas may be placed within number lists for
greater readablility. 
<p>
If more than one variable is specified in the ^varlist^, then the ^varlist^ 
must be delimited by a colon ":". If the rules are placed in parentheses then 
these will act as the delimiter and a colon is optional. delimit the varlist. 
If no colon or opening parentheses is found then the first word of the ^recode2
&gt; ^ 
input string is treated as the varname.
<p>
Following the rules, a "&gt;" may be placed followed by a list of new variable
names into which the variables are to be recoded. The newvarlist must
consist of new variables only. Each variable from the input varlist is
copied to its counterpart in the newvarlist, then recoded. Note that this
implies the "(else=copy)" option of the SPSS recode command.
<p>
^recode2^ transforms SPSS keywords into their Stata counterparts, then passes
the results to Stata's @recode@ command. The following transformations are
applied to the input string:
<p>
" to "     "-"
" into "   "&gt;"
"lo"       "min"
"lowest"   "min"
"hi"       "max"
"highest"  "max"
"else"     "*"
"missing"  "."
"sysmis"   "."
" thru "   "/"
","        " "
"("        " "
")"        " "
<p>
<p>
^Examples^
<p>
recode2 x 1 3/5=6 2 8=3 *=1
recode2 x (1,3 thru 5=6) (2,8=3) (else=1)
recode2 x y z : 1 3/5=6 2 8=3 *=1 &gt; v1-v3
recode2 x y z (1,3/5=6) (2,8=3) (*=1) into v1 to v3
* this will work
recode2 x y z (1 3/5=6 2 8=3 *=1 &gt; v1-v3
* this won't, y and z will be treated as rules.
recode2 x y z  1 3/5=6 2 8=3 *=1 &gt; v1-v3
