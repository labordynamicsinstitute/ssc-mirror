d 'R2_NAKAGAWA': module for computing Nakagawa's R-squared statistic for multilevel mixed-effects linear regression
d
d  r2_nakagawa is a post-estimation command (also see: estat) that
d computes the R-squared statistic following -mixed-.  R-squared is
d computed as described by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013) for
d random intercepts, and extended to random slopes as described by
d Johnson (2014). r2_nakagawa computes the marginal R-squared,
d which is concerned with variance explained by the fixed effects,
d and the conditional R-squared, which is concerned with variance
d explained by both fixed and random effects (Nakagawa and
d Schielzeth 2013).
