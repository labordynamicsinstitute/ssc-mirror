<b>An improved reshape</b>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<b>reshape8</b> improves <b>reshape</b> by preserving variable labels as much as possible
when switching back and forth between long and wide dataset formats. Hence,
taking a dataset from long to wide and back to long will result in getting the
same dataset labelling back again.  When going from wide to long, there are
some labels which are not defined; if they are then defined and the dataset is
reshaped multiple times, they will be persistent.  Aside from the command name,
its usage is otherwise identical to <b>reshape</b>, so see reshape for syntax
information.
<p>
<b><u>Notes</u></b>
<b>reshape8</b> runs only under Stata 8 and above.
