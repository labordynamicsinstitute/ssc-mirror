<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>rts</b> -- Revised Trauma Score
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Version</u></b>
<p>
    Version 3.0.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  ICDPIC Version 3.0 has
    been tested in STATA 10 and STATA 11, but the authors believe it should
    also work without incident in STATA 8 and STATA 9.  If you have any
    problems using ICDPIC Version 3.0 in STATA 8 or STATA 9, please inform
    the authors.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 may be installed from within STATA using the <b>ssc</b>
    command.  If you installed a previous version of ICDPIC from the SSC
    archives website using the <b>ssc</b> command, we suggest that you first delete
    it by typing <b>ssc uninstall icdpic</b> followed by <b>ssc install icdpic</b>.
    Alternatively, you may use <b>ssc install icdpic, replace</b>.  See help for 
    ssc.
<p>
    If you installed any previous ICDPIC files obtained directly from the
    authors, please delete them <b>ALL</b> (.ado, .hlp and .dta files) to avoid any
    conflicts with ICDPIC 3.0 files.
<p>
    Please enter complete variable names in the ICDPIC Version 3.0 dialog
    boxes.  Do not use abbreviations.
<p>
    New to Version 3.0 is the addition of a dialog box (.dlg) file associated
    with each individual ICDPIC Version 3.0 program (.ado) file.  To access
    the ICDPIC dialog box, and all the ICDPIC programs, type: <b>db icdpic</b>.
    Typing <b>icdpic</b>, as in earlier versions, will still work, but <b>ONLY</b> with
    <b>icdpic</b>.  For example, to access the Revised Trauma Score program
    directly, type: <b>db rts</b>.  Typing <b>rts</b>, as in previous versions, will
    produce an error.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to use path\file names
    containing spaces.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to run in STATA 11.0.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is a bug that caused the <b>triss</b> program to
    crash if the <i>rts</i> variable was named anything other than "rts".
<p>
    New in ICDPIC Version 3.0 (<b>trauma</b> program only) is the ability to choose
    whether an AIS value of 6 automatically forces an ISS of 75 or to
    automatically have all AIS values of 6 changed to an AIS value of 5 and
    then have the ISS calculated normally.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have memory.  Each time a dialog
    box is opened within the same STATA session, it will remember the values
    last entered.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have the following buttons:
<p>
      <i>OK</i> executes the program and removes the dialog box from the screen.
<p>
      <i>SUBMIT</i> executes the program and leaves the dialog box on the screen.
             Note that if an error message is generated the dialog box may be
             minimized.
<p>
      <i>CANCEL</i> removes the dialog box from the screen and does nothing.
             Clicking on the close icon of the dialog box does the same
             thing.
<p>
      <i>HELP</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and presents the program help
           file.  The <i>HELP</i> button has a question mark on it.
<p>
      <i>COPY</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and copies the program command
           to the clipboard.
<p>
      <i>RESET</i> resets the values of the controls in the dialog box to their
            initial state, just as if the dialog box were invoked for the
            first time.  Each time a user invokes a dialog box, its controls
            will be filled in with the values the user last entered.  <i>RESET</i>
            restores the control values to their defaults.  The <i>RESET</i> button
            has an R on it.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>db rts</b>
<p>

    instructions.
<p>
                                      <i>OR</i>

    <i>OK</i> or <i>Submit</i>.  The <i>RTS (Revised Trauma Score)</i> dialog box will open.
    Follow the instructions.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>rts</b> calculates the revised trauma score.  The user's data should contain
    Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), systolic blood pressure and respiratory rate
    variables of type integer.
<p>
<p>
                RTS = 0.9368(CGCS) + 0.7326(CBP) + 0.2908(CRR) 
<p>
<p>
    where CGCS is a coded value for the Glasgow Coma Scale, CBP is a coded
    value for systolic blood pressure and CRR is a coded value for
    respiratory rate.
<p>
    See also the <b>Options</b> and <b>Remarks</b> sections for <b>IMPORTANT</b> information on,
    and requirements for, <b>rts</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    The user's data may contain an optional inclusion variable.  This Boolean
    variable should be of type byte and take on the values 0 and 1.  The
    value 0 excludes an observation from having the revised trauma score
    calculated and the value 1 includes the observation in the calculation.
    This option appears in the first <i>Revised Trauma Score</i> dialog box.
<p>
    Revised trauma score coefficients found in the second <i>Revised Trauma</i>
    <i>Score</i> dialog box are the original MTOS weights.  If the user has their
    own database and wishes to calculate their own weights, or use weights
    provided by others, they need only to substitute those weights in the
    second <i>Revised Trauma Score</i> dialog box.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    Revised trauma score will not be calculated if one or more of the GCS,
    systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate or include variables (if this
    option is chosen) contain missing values.
<p>
    <b>rts</b> adds the following variables to a new copy of the user's data stored
    on disk:
<p>
<p>
        <i>rts</i>: revised trauma score
        <i>cgcs</i>: coded Glasgow Coma Scale value
        <i>cbp</i>: coded systolic blood pressure value
        <i>crr</i>: coded respiratory rate value
<p>
<p>
    Coded values for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), systolic blood pressure (BP)
    and respiratory rate (RR) are found in the table below:
<p>
<p>
     <b>GCS</b>          <b>BP</b>          <b>RR</b>          <b>Coded Value</b>
<p>
    13-15         &gt;89        10-29             4
     9-12        76-89        &gt;29              3
     6-8         50-75        6-9              2
     4-5          1-49        1-5              1
      3            0           0               0
<p>
<p>
    Revised trauma score is rounded to the nearest 0.0001.
<p>
    <b>rts</b> produces a variable necessary for <b>triss</b>.  This variable is <i>rts</i>
    (revised trauma score).  The user may rename this variable, but if he/she
    intends on running the results of <b>rts</b> through <b>triss</b>, he/she should not
    delete it.
