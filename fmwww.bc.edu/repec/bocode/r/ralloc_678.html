Description
-----------
<p>
[^ralloc_678^ is the end-of-line version of ^ralloc^ to be used with Stata
releases 6,7 and 8. It is actually ^ralloc^ version 3.2.5.]
<p>
^ralloc^ provides a sequence of treatments randomly permuted in blocks of
constant or varying size.  If not constant, the size and order of the blocks
are also random. Allocation may be stratified by one or more variables.
Randomisation may also proceed simultaneously on 2 factors: 2x2, 2x3, 3x2,
3x3, 2x4, 4x2, 3x4 and 4x3 factorial designs are supported. ^ralloc^ will
also handle a 2x2 crossover design with or without a supplementary 3rd
period as either a "switchback" or "extra period" design (Jones and
Kenward 1989).
<p>
A typical use of ^ralloc^ is in a randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT),
and, in particular, in a multicentred trial where balance in treatment
allocations may be desirable within centre and other defined strata.
<p>
The second syntax displays the syntax diagram for the first syntax.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^sav^ing^(^filename1^)^ specifies the name of the file to which data are saved.
    This is a required "option". If more than one stratum is specified, either
    by the ^strata()^ option or the ^using()^ option then, in addition to
    saving all random allocations across all strata to &lt;filename1&gt;, allocations
    for each stratum may be saved to individual files (see option ^multif^). Fo
&gt; r
    these, &lt;filename1&gt; is used as a stub to name one file for each stratum. The
    schema is:
<p>
                &lt;filename1&gt;_n1[_n2_n3 ... _nk]
<p>
    for a trial with 1 to k stratification variables. n1 identifies the level
    of the stratum of the 1st stratification variable, n2 gives the level of
    the stratum of the 2nd stratification variable etc, each stratification
    variable's set of suffixes being preceded by an underscore character.
    Suffixes are padded with leading zeros to maintain alphanumeric sort order.
    For example, if we specified ^saving(^myfile^)^ and ^multif^ and we had onl
&gt; y
    one stratification variable with 10 levels, the filenames would be: myfile,
    myfile_01, myfile_02, ..., myfile_09, myfile_10 (each with .dta extension).
    If there were a second stratification variable, with say, 3 levels, we
    would have myfile.dta plus 30 files named: myfile_01_1, myfile_01_2,
    myfile_01_3, myfile_02_1, ....., myfile_10_3.
<p>
^multif^ specifies that multiple files will be saved, one holding all
    allocations, and one for each stratum's allocations. The default is
    ^nomultif^ meaning that just one file holding all allocations will
    be generated.
<p>
^se^ed^(^#|"^date^"^)^ specifies the random number seed. If unspecified, the
    default is 1234567879. # should be an integer; if it is not it will be
    truncated. Alternatively, the word "^date^" may be specified which invites
    ^ralloc^ to set the seed to today's date (number of days elapsed since 
    Jan 1 1960).
<p>
^ns^ubj^(^#^)^ specifies the total number of subjects in each stratum requiring
    a random treatment allocation. If unspecified, the default is 100. ^ralloc^
    may yield a number greater than ^nsubj^ if this is required to complete the
    final block. ^ns^ubj^()^ is overridden when a ^us^ing file is specified.
<p>
^nt^reat^(#)^ specifies the number of treatment arms in a non-factorial design:
    2 to 5 may be specified. ^ntreat^ should not be specified in a factorial
    design, as the number of treatment combinations is defined in the ^factor^
    option (see below). If unspecified, the default for a non-factorial design
    is 2.
<p>
^ra^tio^(#)^ specifies the ratio of treatment allocations to the arms of a 2
    treatment non-factorial trial: 1, 2 or 3 may be specified, yielding a
    1:1, 1:2 or 1:3 ratio of allocations respectively. For a 3 or 4 arm
    non-factorial trial only ^ratio(^1^)^, the default, may be specified.
<p>
^os^ize^(1^|^2^|^3^|^4^|^5^|^6^|^7)^ specifies the number of different size blo
&gt; cks.
    For example, if 3 treatment arms are chosen, then ^osize(5)^, the default,
    will yield possible block sizes of 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. Note that it is
    quite possible not to realise some block sizes if the number of subjects
    requested (^nsubj^) is low. ^osize(1)^ gives a constant block size.
<p>
^eq^ual specifies that block sizes will be allocated in equal proportions.
    In the example given under the ^osize^ option, each block would appear
    on roughly 20% of occasions. This may not be desirable: too many small
    blocks may allow breaking the blind; too many large blocks may compromise
    balance of treatments in the event of premature closure. The default
    choice is to allocate treatments in proportion to elements of Pascal's
    triangle. In the above example, if ^equal^ were not specified, or ^noequal^
    appeared, allocation of block sizes would be in the ratio of 1:4:6:4:1.
    That is, the relative frequency of small and large block sizes is
    down-weighted. See the ^init^ option below for another way to limit the
    number of small blocks, albeit at the cost of increasing the number of
    large blocks.  If ^osize^ is 1 or 2, then equality of distribution
    of block size(s) is forced.
<p>
^strat^a^(^#^)^ specifies the number of strata. The default is 1. The number
    of strata can be calculated as the product, over all stratification
    variables, of the levels in each stratification variable. For example,
    if we had a trial running in 10 centres and we further required balance
    over 2 sexes and 3 age groups, then ^strata(^60^)^ would be specified.
    This option may be specified with or without a ^using^ filename (see below)
&gt; .
    If no ^using^ file is specified, each stratum will hold ^nsubj^ allocations
&gt; .
    If a ^using^ file is specified, the value of ^strata^ is overridden by
    the number of rows in the file. Note that ^ralloc^ uses Stata matrices
    and so an absolute upper limit on the number of strata that may be
    specified is 800.
<p>
^us^ing^(^filename2^)^ is a Stata .dta file defining the stratification
    schema. The file must consist solely of variables defining strata
    plus one other variable giving the number of subjects required
    to be randomised in each stratum (the ^countv^ variable, see below).
    This file should reside in the current data path. Each row (observation)
    in this file defines a stratum. Levels of a stratification variable
    must be coded as consecutive positive integers (1,2,3...). ^ralloc^
    will check this and will also check that the product of levels over all
    stratification variables equals the number of rows (strata).
<p>
^count^v^(^variable name^)^ specifies the variable in the ^us^ing file whose
    values give the number of subjects requiring randomisation in each stratum.
    ^count^v^()^ is specified if and only if ^us^ing^()^ is specified. Values
    of the variable specified override the value of ^ns^ubj^()^ should this
    also be specified.
<p>
^shap^e^(long^|^wide)^ allows specification of the output to the saved file(s)
    in either long or wide form. In ^long^ form, the treatment listing is
    sequential down page within the defined block. In ^wide^ form, the
    treatment listing is sequential across page within the defined block.
    The default is ^long^. A factorial or crossover design may not be
    specified as ^wide^.
<p>
^matsiz^(#) sets the maximum size of a Stata matrix. This is a rarely
    used option, as ^ralloc^ chooses a matrix size appropriate to the
    stratification schema specified.
<p>
^trtlab(^string1 string2 ...^)^ allows specification of value labels for
    treatments.  At most 5 labels may be specified for a non-factorial design.
    The number of labels that may be specified for a factorial design is equal
    to the sum of the number of possible treatments in the two randomisation
    axes. For example, 2x3 study will allow 5 labels.  Labels are separated
    by spaces and so may not themselves contain a space.  A label will be
    truncated after the first 8 characters. The default treatment labels are
    A, B, C, D and E (plus F and G if required for a factorial design). An
    older form of the syntax for non-factorial designs, requiring an option
    for each label: ^tr1lab(^string^)^, ^tr2lab(^string^)^, etc, is permitted
    but obsolete.
<p>
^fact^or^(^string^)^ specifies that the trial has a factorial design with two
    "axes of randomisation". The string must be one of: ^2*2^, ^2*3^, ^3*2^, ^3
&gt; *3^,
    ^2*4^, ^4*2^, ^3*4^ or ^4*3^. Allocation combinations are balanced within
    blocks, unless ^fratio^ is specified in a 2x2 design. The names of the two
    treatment variables will be &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;1 and &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;2.
<p>
^frat^io^(^string^)^ specifies, in the case of a 2x2 factorial design, the rati
&gt; o
    of allocations in each axis. The string must be one of: ^1 1^, ^1 2^, ^2 1^
&gt; ,
    or ^2 2^. For example, if we require a 1:2 ratio of treatments in the
    first randomisation axis and a 1:1 ratio of treatments in the second axis,
    ^frat^io^(^2 1^)^ would be specified.
<p>
^xov^er^(^string^)^ specifies the design as a 2x2 crossover. The string argumen
&gt; t
    may be one of ^stand^ for the standard 2 treatment, 2 period design, ^switc
&gt; h^
    for the switchback design where each subject receives the treatment
    assigned for period 1 in period 3, or ^extra^, for the extra period design,
    where each subject has the treatment assigned for period 2 replicated in
    period 3. The names of the treatment variables will be &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;1,
    &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;1 and, if required, &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;3.
<p>
^init(^#^)^ specifies the initiating value of the sequence defining the block
    sizes. ^ralloc^ presents 5 schema:
<p>
      (i) non-factorial design or with balanced allocation:
          ---------------------------------------------
    In this case the default for ^init^ is the number of treatments given by
    ^ntreat^. This may also be specified by ^init(0)^. For example, in a
    3 treatment trial, ^init(9)^ would, if the default ^osize(5)^ is chosen,
    yield block sizes of 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21. If ^init^ were unspecified,
    the block sizes would be 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15.
<p>
     (ii) 2 treatment non-factorial design with unbalanced allocation:
          -----------------------------------------------------------
    When a ^ratio^ &gt; 1 has been specified for a 2 treatment trial, the
    default initiating value of the block size is (^ratio^ + 1).
<p>
    (iii) factorial design with balanced allocation:
          -----------------------------------------
    When not specified the default is the number of treatment combinations,
    for example, 6 in a 2x3 design.
<p>
     (iv) 2x2 factorial design with unbalanced allocation:
          -----------------------------------------------
    When ^fratio^ has been specified the default initiating block size is
    given by:  ((1st arg of ^fratio^) + 1) x ((2nd arg of ^fratio^) + 1).
<p>
      (v) 2x2 crossover design with balanced allocation:
          ---------------------------------------------
    See case (i) above.
<p>
    In all cases, when specified, ^init^ must be an integer multiple of
    the appropriate default.
<p>
^tab^les specifies that a frequency distribution of block sizes is displayed
    for all allocations and, where appropriate, for each stratum. The default
    is ^notab^les.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
^ralloc^ addresses 4 (of the many) objectives of the design of a RCT:
<p>
(1) Random allocation of treatments to subjects. Each block represents
    a random permutation of the 2, 3, 4 or 5 treatments specified.
<p>
(2) Avoiding unnecessary imbalance in the number of subjects allocated to
    each treatment. Allocation within blocks of reasonable size achieves
    this. In the case of a trial with k treatments, even in the event of
    unexpected termination of the trial, the imbalance will be at most
    1/k times the size of the largest block used.
<p>
(3) Maintenance of blinding by concealing the pattern of the blocks. A
    limited number of block sizes are chosen, the number depending on
    the ^osize^ option. Treatments are balanced within blocks; by
    default, equal numbers of each treatment in each block, although
    the ratio may be varied (1:2 or 1:3) in a 2 treatment trial.  Block
    sizes are chosen at random with equal or unequal probabilities
    (depending on the presence of the ^eq^ual option) and then the
    order of block sizes is randomly shuffled. Such a scheme makes
    "breaking the blind" by working out the block pattern extremely
    difficult.  If, however, balance in the number of allocations to
    each treatment is more critical than increased protection against
    breaking the blind, ^osiz^e^(1)^ permits the choice of a constant
    block size.  This may be desired in a trial with a small number of
    subjects.
<p>
(4) Ensuring that a record is kept of the randomisation protocol. The
    program saves the allocation sequence into user-named .dta file(s).
    It also writes a record of the options specified (seed, number of
    subjects requested etc) and certain other useful information (number
    of blocks used, number of subjects randomised, identification of the
    levels of each stratum defining the schema for the current data file)
    as notes into the data file(s).
<p>
<p>
^ralloc^ requires specification of 3 variables that will appear in the data
set(s) that the command creates and saves:
        &lt;BlockIdvar&gt;:    Variable identifying each block.
        &lt;BlockSizevar&gt;:  Variable storing the block size.
        &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;:  Variable storing the randomly allocated treatment;
                         values are 1, 2, 3, etc labelled as "A" "B" "C" etc
                         respectively, unless labels are specified using
                         the ^trtlab^ option. In a factorial or crossover
                         design the variable name may be only 7 characters
                         long to permit a "1", "2", or "3" to be suffixed.
<p>
^ralloc^ creates 2 additional variables:
    ^StratID^ is an integer identifier constant for each observation in a
      given stratum.
    ^SeqInBlk^ that gives the order of the allocation within block.  This
      variable is explicit if the ^shape^ option is ^long^, and implicit
      if ^shape^ is ^wide^.
<p>
If a ^using^ file is specified, ^ralloc^ adds each stratification variable
to the data set and fills observations with the values of the levels
appropriate to the stratum.
<p>
If ^shape(^wide^)^ is specified then each observation will be a block. ^ralloc^
will create k = max(blocksize) new variables named &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;#,
where # = 1...k to store the allocated treatments for that block.  Of course,
if a block's size, j, is such that j &lt; k, missing values are stored in
variables &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;j+1 through &lt;Treatmentvar&gt;k.
<p>
Should the original order of allocations be disturbed, then with the data in
long form, it may be restored by:
<p>
  ^. sort StratiD^ &lt;BlockIdVar&gt; ^SeqInBlk^
<p>
Note that ^ralloc^ issues a ^clear^ command immediately after it is invoked,
so existing data in memory will be lost.
<p>
It is good practice for the user to open a log file before issuing a command
such as ^ralloc^. However, even if the log file is lost, the data files
contain, in the form of notes, the information needed to reproduce the
randomisation protocol.
<p>
<p>
Example 1
---------
<p>
   ^. ralloc block size treat, seed(675) sav(mytrial) shape(wide)^
<p>
Allocates treatments A and B at random in a ratio of 1:1 in blocks of sizes
2 4 6 8 and 10 to 100 subjects. Block sizes are allocated unequally in the
ratio 1:4:6:4:1 (Pascal's triangle). Seed is set at 675. Only 1 stratum is
specified (by default). Sequence is saved to mytrial.dta in wide form.
<p>
<p>
Example 2
---------
<p>
   ^. ralloc bn bs Rx, nsubj(920) nt(2) osiz(4) ra(3) init(8) eq sav(mys)^
<p>
Allocates treatments A and B at random in ratio of 1:3 in blocks of sizes
8 12 16 and 20 to 920 subjects using Stata's default seed of 123456789. Roughly
25% of blocks will be of each size.  Data saved in default (long) form to
mys.dta. Only 1 stratum is specified, and hence 1 file is saved.
<p>
<p>
Example 3
---------
<p>
   ^. ralloc blknum blksiz Rx, ns(494) osiz(2) eq ntreat(2) sav(mywide)^
              ^shap(wide) seed(date) trtlab(Placebo Active) strata(4) multif^
<p>
Allocates treatments labelled "Placebo" and "Active" equally in two block
sizes, 2 and 4, to 494 subjects in each of 4 strata (maybe a 4-centre trial).
The seed is set to today's date in Stata's elapsed days since January 1, 1960.
Data are saved in wide form to 5 files: mywide.dta holds all allocations, and
4 additional files named mywide_1.dta, mywide_2.dta, mywide_3.dta and
mywide_4.dta hold stratum specific allocations.  A truncated listing of data
from mywide_4.dta looks like this:
<p>
  ^. use mywide_4^
  ^. li in 1/7, noobs nodisp^
<p>
<p>
  StratID     blknum     blksiz        Rx1        Rx2        Rx3        Rx4

Example 4
---------
<p>
   ^. ralloc blknum blksiz Rx, ns(4984) osiz(4) ntr(4) sav(mys) strat(3) tab^
<p>
Allocates treatments A, B, C and D at random in ratio of 1:1:1:1 in blocks
of sizes 4, 8, 12 and 16 to 4984 subjects in each of 3 strata using the
default seed. Block sizes are roughly in ratio of 1:3:3:1.

<p>
Example 5
---------
<p>
Let us say we have a file, raltest6.dta, defining strata for a RCT to be
conducted in 3 centres and we also seek to balance allocations within 2
age groups. The number of allocations in each of the 6 strata are held in
the variable "freq".
<p>
 ^. use raltest6^
 ^. li ^
<p>
       centre    agegrp      freq
  1.        1         1        50
  2.        1         2        80
  3.        2         1       140
  4.        2         2       100
  5.        3         1        70
  6.        3         2       100
<p>
Note that ^ralloc^ does not care about the order of variables in the data
set, nor of the sort order of the observations, but it is easier to check
the completeness of the schema if levels are coherently nested.
<p>
The command:
<p>
   ^. ralloc bID bsiz trt, sav(myrct) count(freq) using(raltest6)^
                              ^nsubj(80) seed(54109) multif^
<p>
will cause the following output:
<p>
   Counts defined in variable freq in file raltest6 will override the
    number of subjects specified in option nsubj(80)
<p>
   Number of strata read from file raltest6 is 6
    number of stratum variables is 2
<p>
   stratum variable 1 is centre
   number of levels in centre is 3
<p>
   stratum variable 2 is agegrp
   number of levels in agegrp is 2
<p>
   the stratum design and allocation numbers are:
<p>
       centre  agegrp    freq
   r1       1       1      50
   r2       1       2      80
   r3       2       1     140
   r4       2       2     100
   r5       3       1      70

<p>
<p>
Example 6
---------
<p>
Consider a study that aims to test both the efficacy of a blood pressure
lowering medication, called BPzap, versus a placebo, and the utility of
two weight reduction exercise programs, called GymSweat and JogaBit, versus
normal activity on a specified cardiovascular endpoint. An efficient design
might be a 2x3 factorial RCT (although there are issues of interaction here).
<p>
   ^. ralloc blknum size Rx, sav(rctfact) factor(2*3) osiz(2) eq seed(4512)^
          ^trtlab(BPzap Placebo GymSweat JogaBit normact) nsubj(300)^
<p>
will allocate two treatments, called Rx1 and Rx2, to each of 300 subjects
in a single stratum using a 2x3 factorial design. Blocks of size 6 and 12
with equal frequency will result. After the command we might:
<p>
   ^. list in 1/10^
<p>
<p>
       StratID     blknum       size   SeqInBlk        Rx1        Rx2
  1.         1          1          6          1    Placebo    normact
  2.         1          1          6          2      BPzap    JogaBit
  3.         1          1          6          3      BPzap    normact
  4.         1          1          6          4    Placebo    JogaBit
  5.         1          1          6          5      BPzap   GymSweat
  6.         1          1          6          6    Placebo   GymSweat
  7.         1          2         12          1      BPzap   GymSweat
  8.         1          2         12          2    Placebo    normact
  9.         1          2         12          3      BPzap    normact
 10.         1          2         12          4    Placebo    JogaBit
<p>
So, the 5th subject in Block 1 will receive BPzap and hits the gym, but
the 2nd subject in Block 2 takes Placebo and gets to slob around as usual.
<p>
   ^. tab Rx1 Rx2^
<p>
           |               Rx2
       Rx1 |  GymSweat    JogaBit    normact |     Total
-----------+---------------------------------+----------
     BPzap |        50         50         50 |       150
   Placebo |        50         50         50 |       150
-----------+---------------------------------+----------
     Total |       100        100        100 |       300
<p>
and we note the balance in allocations in each axis of the study.
<p>
<p>
Example 7
---------
<p>
We reformulate the preceding study as a 2x2 study by excluding the JogaBit
treatment. Let's say we wish to have twice as many on Placebo as BPzap, and
also twice as many subjects on normal activity as on the GymSweat regimen.
<p>
   ^. ralloc blknum size Rx, sav(rctfact2) factor(2*2) osiz(2) eq seed(1131)^
        ^trtlab(BPzap Placebo GymSweat normact) fratio(2 2) nsubj(300)^
<p>
This command will give blocks of sizes 9 (the minimum possible with 1:2
allocation ratios in each axis) and 18 (because ^osize(2)^ was specified).
<p>
   ^. tab Rx*^
<p>
           |          Rx2
       Rx1 |  GymSweat    normact |     Total
-----------+----------------------+----------
     BPzap |        34         68 |       102
   Placebo |        68        136 |       204
-----------+----------------------+----------
     Total |       102        204 |       306
<p>
<p>
Example 8
---------
<p>
We have a 2x2 crossover design supplemented by a switchback in period 3.  The
trial compares a new anti-arthritic drug "HipLube" versus aspirin in chronic
osteoarthritis of the hip.
<p>
   ^ralloc Bnum Bsize medic, saving(chronOA) ns(28) trtlab(HipLube aspirin)^
        ^xover(switch) strata(2) osiz(1) init(4)^
<p>
will randomise 56 subjects (28 in each of 2 strata) using blocks of constant
size, 4, and save results to chronOA.dta. Each subject will receive either
HipLube or aspirin in the 1st period, and the other drug in the 2nd period.
The 1st period's drug will be readministered in the 3rd period.
