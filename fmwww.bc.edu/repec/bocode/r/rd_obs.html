    <b>aweight</b>s, <b>fweight</b>s, and <b>pweight</b>s are allowed; see help weights.  Under
    Stata versions 9.2 or before (using locpoly to construct local regression
    estimates) <b>aweight</b>s and <b>pweight</b>s will be converted to <b>fweight</b>s
    automatically and the data expanded. If this would exceed system memory
    limits, error r(901) will be issued; in this case, the user is advised to
    round weights.  In any case, the validity of bootstrapped standard errors
    will depend on the expanded data correctly representing sampling
    variability, which may require rounding or replacing weight variables.
    Under Stata versions 10 or later (using lpoly to construct local
    regression estimates), all weights will be treated as <b>aweight</b>s.

    ----+ Description +------------------------------------------------------
<p>
<b>rd_obs</b> implements a set of regression-discontinuity estimation methods that are
thought to have very good internal validity, for estimating the causal effect
of some explanatory variable (called the treatment variable) for a particular
subpopulation, under some often plausible assumptions.  In this sense, it is
much like an experimental design, except that levels of the treatment variable
are not assigned randomly by the researcher.  Instead, there is a jump in the
conditional mean of the treatment variable at a known cutoff in another
variable, called the assignment variable, which is perfectly observed, and this
allows us to estimate the effect of treatment <i>as if</i> it were randomly assigned
in the neighborhood of the known cutoff.
<p>
<b>rd_obs</b> is an alternative to various regression techniques that purport to allow
causal inference (e.g. panel methods such as xtreg), instrumental variables
(IV) and other IV-type methods (see the ivreg2 help file and references
therein), and matching estimators (see the psmatch2 and nnmatch help files and
references therein).  The <b>rd_obs</b> approach is closest in spirit to an IV model
with one exogenous variable excluded from the regression (<i>excluded instrument</i>),
and one endogenous regressor.
<p>
<b>rd_obs</b> estimates local linear or "kernel" regression models on both sides of
the cutoff.  Estimates are sensitive to the choice of bandwidth, so by default
several estimates are constructed using different bandwidths.
<p>
Further discussion of <b>rd_obs</b> appears in Nichols (2007).
<p>
<a name="examples"></a>        +----------+
    ----+ Examples +---------------------------------------------------------
<p>
In the simplest case, assignment to treatment depends on a variable Z being
above a cutoff Z0.  Frequently, Z is defined so that Z0=0. In this case,
treatment is 1 for Z&gt;=0 and 0 for Z&lt;0, and we estimate local linear regressions
on both sides of the cutoff to obtain estimates of the outcome at Z=0.  The
difference between the two estimates (for the samples where Z&gt;=0 and where Z&lt;0)
is the estimated effect of treatment.
<p>
For example, having a Democratic representative in the US Congress may be
considered a treatment applied to a Congressional district, and the assignment
variable Z is the vote share garnered by the Democratic candidate.  At Z=50%,
the probability of treatment=1 jumps from zero to one. Suppose we are
interested in the effect a Democratic representative has on the federal
spending within a Congressional district.  <b>rd_obs</b> estimates local linear
regressions on both sides of the cutoff like so:
<p>
         ssc inst rd, replace
         net get rd
         use votex if i==1
         rd lne d, gr mbw(100)
         rd_obs lne d, gr mbw(100) line(`"xla(-.2 "Repub" 0 .3 "Democ", noticks
&gt; )"')
         rd_obs lne d, gr ddens
         bs: rd_obs lne d, x(pop-vet)
<p>
In a fuzzy RD design, the conditional mean of treatment jumps at the cutoff,
and that jump forms the denominator of a Local Wald Estimator. The numerator is
the jump in the outcome, and both are reported along with their ratio. Note
that any sharp RD design may be estimated using the fuzzy RD syntax, since the
denominator in that case is just one:
<p>
         use votex if i==1
         rd_obs lne win d, gr mbw(100)
         bs: rd_obs lne win d, x(pop-vet)
         erase votex.dta
<p>
<a name="options"></a>        +-----------------------------+
    ----+ Detailed Syntax and Options +--------------------------------------
<p>
There should be two or three variables specified after the <b>rd_obs</b> command; if
two are specified, a sharp RD design is assumed, where the treatment variable
jumps from zero to one at the cutoff.  If no variables are specified after the
<b>rd_obs</b> command, the estimates table is displayed.

    ----+ Options summary +--------------------------------------------------
<p>
<b>mbw(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> specifies a list of multiples for bandwidths, in percentage terms.
    The default is "100 50 200" (i.e. half and twice the requested bandwidth)
    and 100 is always included in the list, regardless of whether it is
    specified.
<p>
<b>z0(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specifies the cutoff Z0 in <i>assignmentvar</i>.
<p>
<b>x(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b> requests estimates of jumps in control variables <i>varlist</i>.
<p>
<b><u>dd</u></b><b>ens</b> requests a computation of a discontinuity in the density of Z.  This is
    computed in a relatively ad hoc way, and should be redone using McCrary's
    test described at http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/DCdensity/.
<p>
<b>s(</b><i>stubname</i><b>)</b> requests that estimates be saved as new variables beginning with
    <i>stubname</i>.
<p>
<b><u>gr</u></b><b>aph</b> requests that graphs for each bandwidth be produced.
<p>
<b><u>nosc</u></b><b>atter</b> suppresses the scatterplot on those graphs.
<p>
<b><u>sco</u></b><b>pt(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> supplies an option list to the scatter plot.
<p>
<b><u>line</u></b><b>opt(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> supplies an option list to the overlaid line plots.
<p>
<b>n(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specifies the number of points at which to calculate local linear
    regressions.  The default is to calculate the regressions at 50 points
    above the cutoff, with equal steps in the grid, and to use equal steps
    below the cutoff, with the number of points determined by the step size.
<p>
<b><u>bw</u></b><b>idth(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> allows specification of a bandwidth for local linear regressions.
    The default is to choose a bandwidth that gives positive weight to at least
    30 observations on each side of the discontinuity when estimating the
    conditional mean at the cutoff.
<p>
<b><u>k</u></b><b>ernel(</b><i>kerneltype</i><b>)</b> allows specification of a kernel for local linear
    regressions.

<b>rd_obs</b> does not report standard errors by default, nor does it report all saved
estimates.  Instead, it reports the Local Wald Estimate for each bandwidth
used, and its components where applicable. To get all saved estimates, type
<b>rd_obs</b> without arguments or type ereturn list.
<p>
To facilitate bootstrapping, <b>rd_obs</b> saves the following results in <b>e()</b>:
<p>

   <b>e(N)</b>          Number of observations used in estimation
   <b>e(w)</b>          Bandwidth in base model; other bandwidths are reported in
