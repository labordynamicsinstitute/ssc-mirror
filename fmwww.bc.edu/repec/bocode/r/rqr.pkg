d 'RQR': module to estimate the residualized quantile regression model
d
d   The rqr package includes the rqr and rqrplot commands. The rqr
d command implements the residualized quantile regression model,
d which estimates unconditional quantile treatment effects. It is a
d flexible and fast approach that can easily handle all types of
d observed control variables, including high-dimensional fixed
d effects. The rqrplot command effortless plots quantile regression
d coefficients and their confidence intervals.
