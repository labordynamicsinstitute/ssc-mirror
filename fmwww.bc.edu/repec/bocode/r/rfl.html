    <b>rfl</b> is an enhanced most recently used files list allowing a user to open
    a dataset from a list of previously opened datasets. Every file opened
    with <b>rfl</b> is added to a list of recently used files and may be accessed
    via rfl's dialog window or Stata's User menu (in Stata 9, also via
    Stata's Open Recent menu). In addition, the user can set the memory
    allocated to Stata (in fact, <b>rfl</b> automatically determines the amount of
    memory needed to open the dataset), attach a short description to each
    loaded dataset, and open appropriate log and cmdlog files, all in one
    step. If data are present in memory at the time <b>rfl</b> is called, the user
    is prompted to save and close open files from within <b>rfl</b>'s dialog.
<p>
    <b>rfluse</b> calls the ado-files behind <b>rfl</b>'s dialogs without using the dialog
    window. It either opens the specified filename or the #th entry in the
    most recently used files list. Without arguments, # is set to 1, and
    <b>rfluse</b> opens the most recently used dataset. See How to make use of rfl
    without calling the dialog.
<p>
    <b>rflsetmenu</b> adds <b>rfl</b>'s menu to Stata's User menu for easy access to the
    most recently opened datasets. You may want to invoke it only if you do
    not want to use neither <b>rfl</b> nor <b>rfluse</b>, since both set <b>rfl</b>'s menu
    automatically.
<p>
    Please note that <b>rfl</b> has been thoroughly tested on Windows XP systems. It
    also works on other platforms. Stata 8.2 and up (both SE or non-SE) is
    required.

<a name="features"></a><b><u>Features and usage</u></b>
<p>
<a name="first"></a><b><u>First usage</u></b>
    Type <b>rfl</b> (<i>not</i>: db rfl) in the command window. The checkbox "Other
    dataset" will be already checked in the dialog. Click <b>Choose</b> to choose a
    file from the <b>file open</b> dialog. Accept the log and cmdlog files <b>rfl</b>
    suggests or change <b>rfl</b>'s suggestions. Enter a description, if you like
    (otherwise the dataset's label is taken). Press <b>OK</b>. The dataset, the log
    files and the settings chosen will be remembered between sessions (also
    see Other settings), and will be present in the dialog the next time you
    invoke <b>rfl</b>.
<p>
<a name="opening"></a><b><u>Opening a dataset</u></b>
    Type <b>rfl</b> in the command window, or choose <b>rfl (dialog)</b> from Stata's User
    menu (you may also open a dataset from the command window or <b>rfl</b>'s menu,
    see How to make use of rfl without calling the dialog). <b>rfl</b> lets you
    choose among three views of the recent files list:
        <b>(1)</b> a list of the 9 most recently opened datasets, with the dataset
        opened last topping the list,
        <b>(2)</b> a list of all the datasets ever opened, in alphabetical order,
        <b>(3)</b> a list of the descriptions (if you have entered any) of all the
        datasets ever opened, in alphabetical order.
    From each view of the files list, you may select the dataset you want to
    open. If you want to open a dataset which is not yet included in the
    lists, check <b>Other dataset</b> (see First usage). If you don't want to open a
    dataset, check <b>No dataset</b>.
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  The files lists are filled automatically <i>after</i> you have opened
    a dataset. (If you use Stata 9, the dataset is also placed in Stata's
    Open recent menu). File names are shown in the lists in an abbreviated
    form of up to 80 characters. If the abbreviated file name happens to be
    the same as that of another file name, a number in parentheses is added
    to the abbreviated file name. To view the unabbreviated file name, click
    the button <b>Complete info</b>. <b>rfl</b> cannot handle file names which include
    quotation marks like `, ' or ". <b>rfl</b> includes a rudimentary check for
    quotes like ", ', and the macro quote "`" in file names and descriptions
    and will not let you open such files in order to avoid later runtime
    errors. An error message will be displayed in the results window. If a
    file name or description contains an unmatched double quote ("abc), the
    message "unmatched quote" will be displayed without further explanation.
    If you select an entry which is marked for deletion or renaming (see
    Removing a list entry and Renaming a list entry), <b>Del</b> or <b>Ren</b> is displayed
    to the left of the <b>Change description</b> button. If you have prevented <b>rfl</b>'s
    menu from being added to Stata's User menu (see Other settings), you
    cannot access <b>rfl</b> via the menu. You can change the number of entries in
    the recent files list on the second tab of the dialog window (see Other
    settings).
<p>
<a name="datainmemory"></a><b><u>How data in memory are handled</u></b>
    If you call <b>rfl</b> and there are data in memory or open log files, <b>rfl</b>
    displays their file names and offers to save and close the open files. If
    the data in memory have changed since you last saved them, the <b>Save</b>
    checkbox will be checked by default. If the data in memory are unchanged,
    only the <b>Close</b> checkbox will be checked. <b>rfl</b> uses the name under which
    the data was last known to Stata. If you choose to clear changed data
    from memory without saving, you will be prompted for confirmation. No
    changed data will be cleared from memory unless you confirm the
    operation. Note that if you choose not to clear the data from memory, <b>rfl</b>
    cannot change the size of allocated memory (if needed), and will not load
    a dataset. In Stata 9, <b>rfl</b> may also ask you to clear Mata's memory if it
    suspects there are any functions, matrices etc. in Mata. Note that if you
    choose not to clear Mata, Stata will refuse to allow <b>rfl</b> to set the
    memory, and the dataset may or may not be loaded, depending on whether
    there is sufficient memory available. No log or cmdlog file will be
    loaded if you choose not to close the currently open log file(s).
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  <b>rfl</b> relies on Stata's <b>c(changed)</b> when checking whether data in
    memory are changed. Hence it won't recognise changed notes, labels etc.
    Note that if the file names of the open files are too long to be
    displayed in full in the dialog window, you may view the complete names
    by typing the appropriate commands in the command window while the dialog
    is being displayed (disp c(filename), log, cmdlog). <b>rfl</b> will invariably
    save the data in version 8 format (same as version 9). If you need to
    save the data in a previous version's format, you have to do so manually
    (you may do so while <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window is displayed).
<p>
<a name="memory"></a><b><u>Setting the size of memory</u></b>
    <b>rfl</b> does not recognize the size of the memory available on your computer.
    Therefore, for each dataset marked in the lists, <b>rfl</b> proposes the memory
    to be allocated to Stata according to a simple rule: size of dataset
    times 1.5, at least 10 MB, at most 450 MB. You may change the size of
    memory on the main tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog. You may control the memory rule
    from the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog (see Other settings).
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  Note that the percentage of free memory that will be available
    to Stata after the dataset has been opened, which is displayed in the
    dialog, is a rough approximation since it is calculated from integers in
    MB. The actual free memory will differ slightly from the value shown.
<p>
<a name="log"></a><b><u>Choosing a log file</u></b>
    For each dataset you open, you may choose an appropriate log and cmdlog
    file. You have four choices:
        <b>(1)</b> The first choice is a log file whose name is formed from the file
            name of the dataset plus the current date.
        <b>(2)</b> The second choice is the log file opened when this same dataset
            was opened the last time. If there is no last log file associated
            with the dataset, the button shows <i>No last log file yet</i> (in this
            case, the selection of this button does not open a log file).
        <b>(3)</b> The third choice is to not open a log file.
        <b>(4)</b> The fourth choice is to open a log file of your choice by calling
            a standard <i>file open</i> dialog.
    Both a log file and a cmdlog file may be opened. The cmdlog file can be
    chosen from <b>rfl</b>'s second tab. They both have the same name (unless you
    uncheck <b>cmdlog selection follows log selection</b>, see Other settings), but
    different file name extensions. By default, the cmdlog file gets the
    extension txt. The log file extension (smcl or log) and the log file type
    both depend on your set logtype setting. This means, if set logtype is
    set to smcl, both the log file type and the file name extension will be
    smcl, and if set logtype is set to text, the log file type will be text,
    and the file name extension log. You may override the default extensions
    for the log files by choosing <b>Other log file</b> and specifying a file with a
    different file name extension.
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  Log file names may be longer than the width of the dialog
    window and therefore not fully displayed. To view the complete file name,
    click the button <b>Complete info</b>. Log files are always opened with the
    append option, unless you check the <b>Overwrite</b> options on <b>rfl</b>'s second tab
    (see Other settings).
<p>
<a name="description"></a><b><u>Entering or changing a description</u></b>
    Click <b>Enter description</b> to attach a description to a dataset, or click
    <b>Change description</b> to edit the description attached to a dataset. Enter a
    text (of up to 244 characters). Click <b>Done</b> to confirm the description. If
    no description is entered, <b>rfl</b> uses the dataset's label (if any) as its
    description.
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  After a description has been changed, it is not possible to
    view the descriptions list until <b>rfl</b> has been restarted. It is not
    possible to change a description if the descriptions list is in view. Do
    not include quotation marks like `, ' or " in descriptions, and never let
    a description start with a colon (:). <b>rfl</b> cannot handle this (see Opening
    a dataset). Descriptions may be up to 244 characters long. However, only
    an abbreviated description of up to 80 characters is shown in the list. A
    longer part of the description is displayed below the files list (if the
    descriptions list is in view, the file name is displayed instead of the
    description). To display the complete description, click the button
    <b>Complete info</b>. Changes to descriptions of datasets already listed are
    saved instantly, while descriptions of new datasets are stored only after
    the dataset has been opened successfully. The logic of <b>rfl</b> requires the
    abbreviated form of the descriptions to be different for each dataset. If
    you enter similar descriptions for two different datasets which may be
    abbreviated to the same string, <b>rfl</b> resolves the problem by adding a
    number in parentheses to the description shown in the descriptions list.
<p>
<a name="managelist"></a><b><u>Managing the recent files list</u></b>
<p>
<a name="removelistentry"></a>    <b>(1) Removing a list entry</b>
<p>
    <b>rfl</b> stores the file names of all datasets ever opened with <b>rfl</b>. If your
    lists grow large, you may choose to remove list entries manually.  You
    may delete an entry from the files lists by choosing <b>Remove/Rename entry</b>.
    The dialog will alter to give you a choice between <b>Remove</b> and <b>Rename</b>.
    Choose <b>Remove</b>, then click the <b>Submit</b> button, or, if you change your mind,
    click <b>Show logs</b> to cancel the <b>Remove</b> operation. Note that only the list
    entry is removed, whereas the file on the disk remains untouched. See the
    remarks in the section Deleted, moved and renamed datasets.
<p>
<a name="renamelistentry"></a>    <b>(2) Renaming a list entry</b>
<p>
    Within <b>rfl</b>'s dialog, you may also alter a list entry to point to another
    dataset without losing the stored information (useful when a dataset is
    moved to another directory). You may rename an entry in the files lists
    by choosing <b>Remove/Rename entry</b>. The dialog will change to give you a
    choice between <b>Remove</b> and <b>Rename</b>. Choose <b>Rename</b>, then click the <b>Submit</b>
    button, or, if you change your mind, click <b>Show logs</b> to cancel the <b>Rename</b>
    operation. Note that only the list entry is renamed while the file on the
    disk remains untouched. See the remarks in the section Deleted, moved and
    renamed datasets.
<p>
<a name="deletedfiles"></a>    <b>(3) Deleted, moved and renamed datasets</b>
<p>
    If you select a dataset or a description of a dataset which has been
    deleted, moved or renamed on the disk, <b>rfl</b> detects this and asks what it
    should do with the selected entry (cf. Removing a list entry and Renaming
    a list entry). Make your choice and click the <b>Submit</b> button, or, if you
    change your mind, click <b>Show logs</b> to leave the recent files list
    unchanged.
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  If you want to rename and/or remove more than one list entry at
    a time, you may do so. Note that if you click <b>Remove/Rename entry</b> a list
    entry is not immediately removed or renamed, but marked for deletion or
    renaming. The actual renaming or removal from the list of an entry will
    take place the next time <b>rfl</b> is called (<b>rfluse</b> and the menu do not
    respect the rename or remove markers). There is no way to recall an entry
    marked for deletion from within <b>rfl</b>. However, you may open rfl.log (see
    How rfl stores the information) and edit the file manually. Be sure to
    close <b>rfl</b> before.
    If you rename a list entry by pointing it to a file which already has an
    own entry in the files list, the entry you want to rename will be removed
    from the files list after applicable information has been tranferred to
    the existing entry. No information in the existing entry will be
    overwritten. You will have to confirm the operation.
<p>
<a name="memory"></a><b><u>Setting the size of memory</u></b>
    <b>rfl</b> does not recognize the size of the memory available on your computer.
    Therefore, for each dataset marked in the lists, <b>rfl</b> proposes the size of
    memory to be allocated to Stata according to a simple rule: size of
    dataset times 1.5, at least 10 MB, at most 450 MB. You may change the
    size of memory on the main tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog. You may control the
    memory rule from the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog (see Other settings).
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  Note that the percentage of free memory that will be available
    to Stata after the dataset has been opened, which is displayed to the
    left of the memory spinner, is a rough approximation since it is
    calculated from integers in MB. The actual free memory will differ
    slightly from the value shown.
<p>
<a name="datainmemory"></a><b><u>How data in memory are handled</u></b>
    If you call <b>rfl</b> and there are data in memory or open log files, <b>rfl</b>
    displays their file names and prompts you to save and to close the open
    files. If the data in memory have changed since you last saved them, the
    <b>Save</b> checkbox will be checked by default. If there are unchanged data in
    memory, only the <b>Close</b> checkbox will be checked. <b>rfl</b> uses the name under
    which the data was last known to Stata. If you choose to clear changed
    data from memory without saving, you will be prompted for confirmation.
    No changed data will be cleared from memory unless you confirm the
    operation. Note that if you choose not to clear the data from memory, <b>rfl</b>
    cannot change the size of allocated memory (if needed), and will not load
    a dataset. No log or cmdlog file will be loaded unless you choose to
    close the currently open log file(s).
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  <b>rfl</b> relies on Stata's <b>c(changed)</b> when checking whether data in
    memory are changed. Hence it won't recognise changed notes, labels etc.
    Note that if the file names of the open files are too long to be
    displayed in full in the dialog window, you may view the complete names
    by typing the appropriate commands in the command window while the dialog
    is being displayed (disp c(filename), log, cmdlog). <b>rfl</b> will invariably
    save the data in version 8 format (same as version 9). If you need to
    save the data in a previous version's format, you must do so manually
    (you may do so while <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window is displayed).
<p>
<a name="nodlg"></a><b><u>How to make use of rfl without calling the dialog</u></b>
<p>
<a name="fromcommand"></a>    <b>(1) From the command window</b>
<p>
    In general you shouldn't bother with this cumbersome command-line version
    of <b>rfl</b>. Specify all the settings you need in <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window, make
    them permanent and then use <b>rfl</b>'s menu (cf. the next section From the
    menu).
    But if you really want to know: <b>rfluse</b> lets you open a dataset from the
    command window without using <b>rfl</b>'s dialog. If you specify a file name for
    the dataset, don't enclose it in quotes. You may also specify a log file,
    a cmdlog file and a description. If no log files are specified, the log
    files opened are controlled by the option <b>l()</b>. <b>l(1)</b> opens the log files
    which would be the first choice in <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window, and <b>l(2)</b> opens
    the log and cmdlog files used when this same dataset was last opened.
    <b>l(3)</b> tells <b>rfluse</b> not to open any log or cmdlog file. If the <b>l()</b> option
    is not specified, its value is taken from the <b>Load last log files</b> setting
    on the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window (see Other settings). If the
    description specified in the <b>desc</b> option differs from the stored one, the
    stored one is overwritten. If you do not specify a description, the
    stored one remains unchanged. You may specify the parameters <b>ds</b>, <b>dc</b>, <b>lc</b>,
    <b>cc</b> to handle data in memory and open log files. <b>ds</b> saves the data in
    memory, <b>dc</b> clears the data from memory, <b>lc</b> closes an open log file, and
    <b>cc</b> closes an open cmdlog file. If you do not specify these options and
    <b>rfluse</b> encounters data in memory or open log files, a dialog window will
    pop up to ask you how to handle them (cf. How data in memory are
    handled). <b>rfluse</b> does not recognise remove and rename markers and
    therefore uses such files list entries as if they were not marked. For
    <b>rfluse</b> to work properly, <b>rfl</b> must have been called at least once before.
    <b><u>Examples:</u></b>
    <b>. rfluse</b> opens the most recently used file and its accompanying log and
    cmdlog files, as specified in the <b>Load last log files</b> setting on the
    second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window, if no data are present in memory
    <b>. rfluse , l(3) dc cc lc</b> opens the most recently used file after having
    cleared data from memory and closed open log files, but opens no log or
    cmdlog file.
    <b>. rfluse 4</b> opens the 4th entry in the recent files list and its
    accompanying log and cmdlog files, as specified in the <b>Load last log</b>
    <b>files</b> setting on the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window, if no data are
    present in memory
    <b>. rfluse 4, l(2) dc cc lc</b> opens the 4th entry in the recent files list
    and the log and cmdlog files used when this same data file was last
    opened, after having cleared data from memory and closed open log files.
    <b>. rfluse 7, desc(different description)</b> opens the 7th entry in the <b>Most</b>
    <b>recent</b> list and its accompanying log and cmdlog files, as specified in
    the <b>Load last log files</b> setting on the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window,
    and attaches "different description" to the entry, if no data are present
    in memory
    <b>. rfluse c:\mydata, desc("different description (version 2)") log(other</b>
    <b>log) cmdlog(yet another log) mem(200) ds dc lc cc</b> saves the data in
    memory, clears the memory, closes both log files, opens c:\mydata, other
    log.smcl and yet another log.txt in your current (working) directory and
    attaches "different description (version 2)" (note the quotes required
    because of the parentheses) to the entry, after having saved the data in
    memory, cleared the memory, closed any open log files, and allocated 200
    MB of memory to Stata. Note that the file names are not enclosed in
    quotes.
<p>
<a name="frommenu"></a>    <b>(2) From the menu</b>
<p>
    Upon the first invocation of <b>rfl</b> or <b>rfluse</b> during a Stata session, <b>rfl</b>'s
    menu system is added to Stata's User menu. From there, one can call <b>rfl</b>'s
    dialog or open the recently used files by typing 1,2,...,9 or selecting
    them with the mouse. The calls from the menu work much the same way as
    does <b>rfluse</b> called with a data file name. However, you cannot specify a
    log file directly (the log files opened are specified in the <b>Load last</b>
    <b>log files</b> setting on the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window, see Other
    settings) and you cannot change an entry's description. If there are data
    in memory, or open log files, a dialog window will pop up asking you how
    to handle them (cf. How data in memory are handled). <b>rfl</b>'s menu shows
    abbreviated file names (which may not be fully shown by Stata's menu
    system).
    <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  Due to the static nature of Stata's menu system, the order of
    the entries in the menu will not always reflect the re-ordering of the
    files list entries <b>rfl</b> undertakes when you close and open files during a
    Stata session. Thus, the order of the menu items will differ from the
    order in the <b>Most recent</b> list of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog (or from Stata 9's Open
    Recent list) after <b>rfl</b> has been called for the second time during one
    Stata session. Similarly, entries removed from the files list will not be
    removed from <b>rfl</b>'s menu, and a renamed entry will appear with its new
    file name only at the bottom of <b>rfl</b>'s menu, while the original file name
    will stay in place, unless you restart Stata. Files not present in the
    menu at the beginning of a Stata session and opened subsequently will be
    appended to the bottom of the menu (without a preceding number), if
    opened with <b>rfl</b> or <b>rfluse</b>.
    However, you may tell <b>rfl</b> to rewrite the menu each time it re-orders the
    files list, thus showing the files in the menu in their correct order, by
    checking <b>Rewrite rfl's menu</b> on the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog (see Other
    settings). Be aware that checking this option will also remove all other
    menu items in Stata's User menu each time <b>rfl</b> rewrites the menu. If you
    don't like <b>rfls</b>'s menu system, you may prevent it from being installed.
    To do so, check <b>Hide rfl's menu</b> on the second tab of the dialog.
<p>
<a name="other"></a><b><u>Other settings</u></b>
    On the second tab of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window, you may control how <b>rfl</b> works.
    As soon as you change any of these settings, the button <b>Make settings</b>
    <b>permanent</b> is enabled. Click it to make changes permanent. Otherwise the
    settings will be in effect only for the dataset you're about to open.
    (1) To dispense with <b>rfl</b>'s menu, check <b>Hide rfl's menu</b>.
    (2) Make your choice with the <b>List of recent files</b> spinner to change the
        number of files displayed in the <b>Most recent</b> list and in <b>rfl</b>'s menu.
    (3) If you want the menu to always be up-to-date during a Stata session,
        and its entries ordered like those in Stata 9's <b>Open Recent</b> menu,
        check <b>Rewrite rfl's menu</b>. Be aware that <b>rfl</b> removes <i>any</i> menu item
        added by another program (but not Stata's default menu) when
        rewriting the menu.
    (4) Check <b>Load last log files</b> if you want <b>rfl</b> to open the same log files
        that were previously used with a dataset (cf. Choosing a log file)
        when the dataset is called from the menu or from <b>rfluse</b>. Uncheck it
        if you want <b>rfl</b> to open log files whose name is formed from the file
        name of the dataset plus the current date (cf. Choosing a log file)
        when opening a dataset using the menu or <b>rfluse</b>. This setting also
        affects the default choice in the <b>Log file to use</b> and <b>cmdlog file to</b>
        <b>use</b> sections of <b>rfl</b>'s dialog window.
    (5) Set the<b> number of recent commands</b> from a cmdlog file you're opening
        to add them to the review window. The default is 0.
    (6) If you check <b>cmdlog selection follows log selection</b>, the cmdlog
        choice on the second tab will always be the same as the log choice on
        the first tab.  Thus, if you select the second choice from the <b>Log</b>
        <b>file to use</b> section, the second choice from the <b>cmdlog file to use</b>
        section will be selected, too. If you uncheck the option, <b>rfl</b> lets
        you make your log and cmdlog choices independently of each other.
    (7) Check <b>Replace the log file to be opened</b> if you want the log file to
        be opened with the <b>replace</b> option, uncheck it, if you want the log
        file to be opened with the <b>append</b> option (cf. help for log).
    (8) Check <b>Replace the cmdlog file to be opened</b> if you want the cmdlog
        file to be opened with the <b>replace</b> option, uncheck it, if you want
        the cmdlog file to be opened with the <b>append</b> option (cf. help for 
        log).
    (9) Check <b>Don't warn me before replacing a log or cmdlog file</b> if you do
        not wish to receive a reminder when you have chosen to open log or
        cmdlog files with the <b>replace</b> option. This setting is only respected
        if you use <b>rfl</b>'s dialog. If you use <b>rfl</b>'s menu or <b>rfluse</b>, a warning
        message will always pop up. See the next entry for a possibility to
        circumvent this behaviour.
    (10) Check <b>Make a backup copy before overwriting</b> log files if you want to
        back-up your log files before replacing them. The back-ups will be
        named &lt;file name&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;.bkp. (If the file names are very long,
        log files with the extension smcl will be renamed to have the
        extension sbkp, those with the extension log will be renamed to have
        the extension lbp, and cmdlog files will be renamed to have the
        extension bkp). By checking this option, you will also prevent the
        reminder from showing up if you have checked <b>Don't warn me before</b>
        <b>replacing a log or cmdlog file</b> and use <b>rfl</b>'s menu or <b>rfluse</b>.
    (11) Under <b>Memory settings</b>, you may change the rule <b>rfl</b> applies when
        proposing the memory to be allocated to Stata on the main tab. With
        the spinner in the first line of this section, you tell <b>rfl</b> by how
        much it should multiply the file size of a dataset (divide the number
        shown by 10). The spinners in the second line define a lower and an
        upper limit for the memory proposed on the main tab. The amount of
        memory <b>rfl</b> actually allocates to Stata may still be set on the main
        tab.
<p>
<a name="windowtitle"></a><b><u>The Stata window title (Windows &amp; Unix only)</u></b>
    If a dataset is opened with <b>rfl</b>, the Stata window title is set to the
    file name of the dataset. If you close a dataset with <b>rfl</b> (check <b>No data</b>
    <b>file</b>), the Stata window title is reset to the default. However, if you
    close a dataset without using <b>rfl</b>, the Stata window title is not
    restored.  To reset the windows title to the default, invoke <b>rfl</b>, choose
    the second tab, and press<b> Reset Stata's window title</b>. Press <b>Cancel</b> if you
    do not want to open a dataset.
<p>
<a name="storeinfo"></a><b><u>How rfl stores the information</u></b>
    <b>rfl</b> makes use of a single text file (rfl.log) written to your PERSONAL
    directory. Every time <b>rfl</b> or <b>rfluse</b> is started, a backup copy (rfl.bkp)
    is created. In addition, upon invocation of <b>rfl</b> the files rflliall.idlg,
    rflldesc.idlg, and rfllast5.idlg are created and written to your PERSONAL
    directory. Make sure no files with these names that you may need for
    other purposes are present when you invoke <b>rfl</b>, because they will be
    overwritten without warning. Two global variables (rfl_SETMENU,
    rfl_SETMENU_no) are defined. They control <b>rfl</b>'s menu. In rfl.log, the
    first 15 lines are reserved for <b>rfl</b>'s menu, log and memory settings.
        Line 1: rfl version
        Line 2: hidemenu (default 0)
        Line 3: rewrite menu (default 0)
        Line 4: entries in recent file list (default 9)
        Line 5: Always load last log, if called from menu or from rfluse
        (default 1)
        Line 6: cmdlog selection follows log selection (default 1)
        Line 7: replace log (default 0)
        Line 8: replace cmdlog (default 0)
        Line 9: don't warn before replacing log and cmdlog (default 0)
        Line 10: Minimum memory allocated to Stata when opening a dataset
        (default 10)
        Line 11: Maximum memory allocated to Stata when opening a dataset
        (default 450)
        Line 12: multiply dataset file size by this factor (default 1.5 [=15
        in the dialog control])
        Line 13: make backup of log files before overwriting (default 0)
        Line 14: Number of commands to be added from the opened cmdlog file
        to the review window (default 0)
        Line 15: empty
    From line 16 onwards, the list entries are stored. The most recently used
    dataset comes first. Each list entry occupies 15 lines. The structure of
    each list entry is as follows:
        Line 1: Number of times the dataset has been opened
        Line 2: Most recent status: 5 = most recent, 4 most recent but 1,
        etc.
        Line 3: dataset file name (short)
        Line 4: dataset file name (long)
        Line 5: cmdlog file name (long)
        Line 6: log file name (long)
        Line 7: description (short)
        Line 8: description (long)
        Lines 9-13: empty
        Line 14: new dataset file name (only if a list entry has been altered
        to point to a different file [i. e. renamed])
        Line 15: actions on next start (delete, rename)
    You can safely delete the files rfllast5.idlg, rflldesc.idlg, and
    rflliall.idlg in your PERSONAL directory without losing any information.
    If you delete rfl.log, you will start from scratch.
<p>
<a name="call"></a><b><u>How to call rfl on each start of Stata</u></b>
    Simply add the command <b>rfl</b> to your profile.do:
        (other commands)
        <b>rfl</b>
        (more commands, if you like, but <b>rfl</b> is recommended to be the last
        line)
    Alternatively, you may place <b>rflsetmenu</b> into your profile.do.
<p>
<a name="problems"></a><b><u>Known problems and unexpected behaviour</u></b>
    <b>(1)</b> In rare circumstances, <b>rfl</b> may not react to mouse clicks as expected.
        Specifically, regardless of where you click on the screen, it may
        repeat the last action again and again (but does not produce unwanted
        results). To regain control, either press the up or down arrow keys,
        or, if this does not help, change to some other window without using
        the mouse (e.g. by pressing &lt;alt&gt;+&lt;tab&gt; on Windows platforms), and
        then return to <b>rfl</b>. Now normal behaviour of <b>rfl</b> should be restored.
        <b><u>Remarks</u></b><b>:</b>  This seems to be a Stata or a Windows problem related to
        the focus of the radio buttons. It has been observed on a Windows
        platform when changing from one list to another and the selected
        entry in the list you're changing to produces a message saying the
        file could not be found.
    <b>(2)</b> Stata allows you to open a log file and a cmdlog file both with the
        same file name and extension. If you choose a log file with the
        extension txt, <b>rfl</b> does not correct the choice and opens the same
        file as a log and a cmdlog file. I didn't explore the consequences of
        doing so.
    <b>(3)</b> In very rare circumstances, double entries may be added to <b>rfl</b>'s menu
        during one and the same Stata session. In practical use, this
        behaviour should never occur. Anyway, it does not affect the
        functionality of the menu. You'd simply have 2 or more menu items to
        choose the same dataset from.
