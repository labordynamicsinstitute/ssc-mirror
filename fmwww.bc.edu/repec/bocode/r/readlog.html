help for ^readlog^

Usage
-----
        ^readlog^ , logfil(string)  [all(string) start(string) stop(string) 
                                     spaces del]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
^readlog^ reads in a file and processes it using some or all of the specified 
          options.
<p>
^readlog^ reads in a file line by line. Only certain lines are output. The 
processing includes starting and stopping at lines containing certain strings, 
including all lines with certain strings. ^readlog^ may also try to process 
files for reading in a spreadsheet program. 
<p>
With no options, it echoes all lines. Useful for combining with spaces.
<p>
To do anything useful, you need to capture the output with "log using" 
and "log close" before or after. Please tell me if you want this included as 
part of the present command.
<p>
Options
-------
all     Outputs all lines containing this string
<p>
start
stop    Includes all lines starting with "start" and "stop"
<p>
spaces  Replaces certain character combinations with a semicolon ;
        These include double spaces and "| ". These are combinations
        that makes importing tables into a spreadsheet easier.
<p>
del     deletes the original log-file
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
        The "spaces" option is imperfect as a table processor. 
        Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
1.      log using "processed output"
        readlog , logfil("study.log") start("logistic regression") stop("-&gt;")
        log close
<p>
        Gives you the output of only the logistic regression in the logfile
<p>
2.      log using "processed output"
        readlog , logfil("study.log") start("logistic regression") stop("-&gt;") s
&gt; paces
        log close
<p>
        Gives you the output of only the logistic regression in the logfile
        and processes the outputs so that coefficients and confidence intervals
        are easier to use
