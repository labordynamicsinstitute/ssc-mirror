d 'RBIPROBIT': module to estimate recursive bivariate probit regressions
d
d  rbiprobit is a user-written command that fits a recursive
d bivariate probit regression using maximum likelihood estimation.
d The model involves an outcome equation and a treatment equation,
d whereas the treatment variable is an endogenous explanatory
d variable of the outcome equation. Both dependent variables have
d to be binary. Postestimation commands allow to compute various
d treatment effects and a decomposition of marginal effects.
