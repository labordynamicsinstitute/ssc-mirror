    <b>r2o</b> --      r2o ordinal explained variation statistic

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>r2o</b> calculates the ordinal explained variation statistic (i.e., R²)
    described by Lacy (2006), which is used to summarize the fit of a
    regression model for an ordinal response. It rests on an ordinal
    variation measure that entails no assumptions about intercategory
    distances or distributional form.  This measure is valid regardless of
    the method used to estimate the model, and was shown to outperform
    various pseudo-R² measures in estimating the value of the true R² for a
    regression model for an underlying continuous response, even though its
    sense does not require such.  <b>r2o</b> is to be used after a relevant
    categorical response model has been run, while the e() list is still
    intact. By default, the program recognizes the following as relevant
    response models: <b>ologit</b>, <b>oprobit</b>, <b>mlogit</b>, and <b>gologit2</b>. However, <b>r2o</b>
    should work after any estimation command for which <b>predict</b><i> p1,..., pk</i>
    will calculate predicted probabilities, and which follows official
    Stata's conventions for naming items in the e() list.

      <b>trustme</b>          will make the program run regardless of whether an
                        estimation command it recognizes has just been run.
      <b>nomarg</b>           suppresses the display of the marginal distribution of
                        the response variable.

<b><u>Saved results</u></b>
<p>
<b>r2o</b> saves the following in <b>r()</b>:
      <b>r(vtot)</b>         total variation in the response variable
      <b>r(verr)</b>         error variation, i.e., the conditional variation in the
                       response
      <b>r(vmodel)</b>       variation explained by the model
      <b>r(r2o)</b>          ordinal explained variation statistic.
      <b>r(ur2o)</b>         bias adjusted version of r2o.
