Description
-----------
<p>
^reswage^ uses maximum likelihood and Breen's likelihood function (in ^reswage_
&gt; ll.ado^,
see "Remarks" below for bibliographic information) to estimate a selection regr
&gt; ession 
model with endogenous selection.  ^reswage^ provides an alternative to the stan
&gt; dard 
Heckman two-step or MLE selection models, with the primary distinction being ^r
&gt; eswage^
relaxes the assumption of the exogeneity of the sampling mechanism; e.g., wage 
&gt; offers 
influence the likelihood of employment and hence the odds of observing wages. 
<p>
Sample selection models such as Heckman are notoriously difficult to identify, 
&gt; and 
^reswage^ is no exception to this general rule.  The likelihood function as spe
&gt; cified 
in ^reswage_ll.ado^ is identified via the assumption of no error correlation be
&gt; tween 
the error terms in the equations predicting observed wages and reservation wage
&gt; s.  In 
models where there are no good instruments to adequately differentiate between 
&gt; these 
two equations, there will likely be difficulties in getting ^reswage^ to conver
&gt; ge.  
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
dummy(^censor_indicator^) specifies which cases have censored values of ^depvar
&gt; ^.  
If this option is not utilized, a dummy variable will be created for you on the
&gt;  basis
of whether ^depvar^ is missing.  
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>

&gt; MODELS:
