Small-Hsiao Test for IIA in multinomial logit
---------------------------------------------
<p>
        ^smhsiao^ ^,^ ^e^lim(yvalue) [ ^s^amp(sampvar) ^d^etail mlogit_options
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^smhsiao^ conducts the Small-Hsiao test for Independence of Irrelevant
Alternatives after a multinomial logit model.
<p>
The command displays the test statistic, degrees of freedom and P-value,
and places values in the return array. ^return list^ for details.
<p>
The command uses the e(sample) defined in ^mlogit^ to define the 
observations over which the test is to be computed.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^elim(^#^)^ specifies the value of the dependent variable that should be
   excluded from the second-stage estimation. This is a required.
   Note that different test results can occur when different categories
   are excluded.
<p>
^samp(^varname^)^ specifies a variable that divides the data set into two
   half samples for estimation. This variable must take on two (and only
   two values). If it is not specified, the sample is divided randomly 
   roughly in half.
<p>
^detail^ indicated that the various intermediate estimations should be
   displayed. By default they are not.
<p>
^mlogit_options^: any other valid options for the mlogit command, such as
   ^robust^, may be specified as well.
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
   . ^smhsiao, elim(3) samp(sampvar)^
<p>
        Estimates a multinomial logit model of pid, race and gender on
        vote, and then calculates the Small-Hsiao test of IIA using 
        vote==3 as the eliminated category. The variable sampvar
        indicates the two half-samples.
