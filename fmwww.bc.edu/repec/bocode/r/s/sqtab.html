<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>sqtab</b> displays frequency tables of all sequences in the dataset.
    Sequences are described by listing the first 38 positions of each
    sequence.
<p>
    If the optional variable name is specified, a cross tabulation of the
    sequences with the specified variable will be produced.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>ranks(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> is used to restrict the output to the most frequent
        sequences. <i>numlist</i> refers to the position of the sequences in the
        sorted frequency table. Hence, <b>ranks(1)</b> refers to the most frequent
        sequence only, whereas <b>ranks(1/10)</b> refers to the 10 most frequent
        sequences. You can also specify <b>ranks(2(2)20)</b>.
<p>
    <b>se</b> is used to request a frequency table, where similar sequences have
        been grouped together beforehand. The concept for similarity used
        with the option <b>so</b> is called same elements similarity, because it
        treats sequences that consist of the same elements as identical.
        Hence, with this option the sequence B-A-A-B would be treated as
        identical to A-B-B-A, because both sequences consist of the elements
        A and B.
<p>
    <b>so</b> is used to request a frequency table, where similar sequences have
        been grouped together beforehand. The concept for similarity used
        with the option <b>so</b> is called same order similarity, because it treats
        sequences where the elements appear in the same order. The sequence
        A-B-B-A would be treated identical to A-B-A-A, because the elements A
        and B appear in the same order in both sequences (first A, then B,
        and then A again).
<p>
    <b>nosort</b> changes the default of listing sequences in the table according to
        their frequency. This change is reasonable, because many sequences
        are probably unique. The option <b>nosort</b> turns this default behavior
        off.
<p>
    <b>gapinclude</b> is used to include sequences with gaps in the tabulation. The
        default behavior is to drop sequences with gaps from the tabulation,
        because they cannot be used in the program <b>sqom</b>.  The term gap refers
        only to missing values on the element variable within a sequence.
        Sequences with missing values at the beginning and at the end of a
        sequence are included in any case. See sq for details.
<p>
    <b>subsequence(a,b)</b> is used to include only the part of the sequence that is
        between position a and b, whereby a and b refer to the position
        defined in the order variable.
<p>
    <i>tabulate_options</i> are any of the options documented in <b>tabulate oneway</b> or 
        <b>tabulate twoway</b>.
