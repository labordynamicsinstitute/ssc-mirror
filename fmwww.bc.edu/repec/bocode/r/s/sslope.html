        <b>(x z x-squared xz)</b> (quadratic plus linear interaction), gives slope of
        criterion variable on x at levels of x and z. Also calculates the
        minumum or maximum of the curves.
<p>
        OR
<p>
        <b>(z x x-squared xz)</b> (quadratic plus linear interaction), gives slope of
        criterion variable on z at levels of x.

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
This calculates simple slopes for interactions between continuous variables in
linear regression analysis.  For example, the slope of the criterion on x
conditional upon z. All continuous variables in the regression must be centered
at the mean. The simple slope of interest must be specified in <b>i</b>. This must be
of the form x(slope of interest) z(moderating variable) xz(the interaction
between the two). Hence, <b>i</b>(x z xz) provides a different result than <b>i</b>(z x xz).
Both are correct, one is the slope of y on x conditional upon z and the other,
the slope of y on z conditional upon x. However, <b>i</b>(x xz z) will produce
incorrect results.  Similarly, for a three-way interaction, <b>i</b> must be in the
form of (x z w xz xw zw xzw) for the slope of x conditional upon z and w.
<u>Important</u>, the order i(x z w xz <i>wz</i> xw xzw) will not produce the correct
results. The order is x (slope of interest) z w (first order terms of the
moderators) x^2 (x quadratic term) xz xw (2-way interactions with x) zw (the
2-way interaction of the moderators without x) xzw (the three way interaction).
The order of variables in varlist does not matter but calculations of the
simple slopes depend upon the specified order in <b>i</b>. Simple slopes associated
with both an interaction and a quadratic term (i.e., y on x when there are both
xz and x-squared terms) are not supported at this time.  The calculations are
based upon the formulas provided in Aiken &amp; West (1991).
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>sd(#)</b> specifies the conditional levels of interest of z and/or w, in sd units,
default = 1.0.
<p>
<b>Graph</b> requests a graph of the conditional slopes. Continuous variables not
included in the interaction are held constant at mean=0, if there are
dichotomous variables in the model, this option creates graphs for a
category=0, if there is not a category=0, the intercepts will be invalid.
<p>
<b>go</b> requests a graph as above, but accepts all standard graph options for
<b>scatter</b>.  Choose either <b>Graph</b> for the default graph OR <b>go</b> and define graph
options.
<p>
<b>Fits</b> requests the conditional fitted values be saved. This is included to
facilitate making additional graphs.
