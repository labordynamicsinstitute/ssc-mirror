<b><u>Replication-based estimates of covariances for complex survey data</u></b>

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>svrest</b> runs the user-specified <i>command</i>, and calculates covariance estimates for
the statistics specified in <i>exp_list</i>, using replication methods for complex
survey data.  <b>svrest</b> is based on bs.
<p>
The expressions in <i>exp_list</i> must be separated by spaces and there must be no
spaces within each expression.  Note that <i>command</i> and <i>exp_list</i> must both be
enclosed in double quotes.
<p>
See survwgt and svr for details on these replication methods.
<p>
<b>svrest</b> estimates the statistics jointly, so it calculates both the variances of
each statistic, and the covariances among them.  The results are stored as
estimates.
<p>
See svresttest for testing hypotheses involving the estimated statistics
generated by this command.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>matrices</b> indicates one entire matrices of results to be included.  This allows
    the easy display of the entire coefficient vector when using <b>svrest</b> for an
    estimation command not supported by brrmodel.  For example, the following
    would compute replication-based standard errors for the full coefficient
    vector from a heckman model:
<p>
        . svrest "heckman income age race weight, select(education)" ,
        mat(e(b))
<p>
<b>Important note:</b> It is vital that the estimation in each replicate produce the
same coefficient vector.  Thus, for example, when running <b>mlogit</b>, be sure to
include the <b>base()</b> option, so that the same category is omitted from the
estimation for every replicate.
<p>
<b>dots</b> requests a dot be placed on the screen at the beginning of each
    replication, thus providing entertainment of a sort when long, slow
    commands are run.
<p>
<b>noisily</b> requests that output from each replication be displayed.
<p>
<b>or</b> requests that statistics be displayed as odds ratios.
<p>
<b>liststats</b> requests that a key be displayed, indicating what each statistic is.
<p>
<b>diparm</b> requests that single equation statistics be redisplayed in the natural
    metric.  You must indicate the name of the equation containing the
    statistic, the type of transformation, the name for the statistic, and,
    optionally, <b>ci</b> to indicate that the confidence interval should be
    appropriately transformed.  When specified, this option simply calls 
    _diparm to redisplay statistics that are not estimated in their natural
    metric.  For example, for <b>heckman</b>, you might do the follwowing:
<p>
        . svrest "heckman income age, select(educ)" , mat(e(b)) diparm(athrho
        exp rho ci \ lnsigma exp sigma di)
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
        . svrest "reg mpg weight foreign" "_b[weight] _b[foreign]"
<p>
        . svrest "kappa cat1-cat3" "r(z)"
<p>

<p>
I would like to thank members of the Stata technical team, whose suggestions
led to the creation of this command.
