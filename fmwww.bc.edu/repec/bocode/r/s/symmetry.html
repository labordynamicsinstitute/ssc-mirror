Description
- -----------
<p>
^symmetry^ performs symmetry and marginal homogeneity tests on square NxN
tables where there is a 1 to 1 matching of cases and controls
(non-independence).  In genetics, the test is known as the
Transmission/Disequilibrium test (TDT) and is used to test the association
between transmitted and non-transmitted parental marker alleles to an affected
child.

Options
- -------
<p>
^notable^ suppresses the output of the contingency table. 
<p>
^contrib^ reports the contribution of each off-diagonal cell-pair to the
    overall symmetry chi-square.
<p>
^exact^ performs an exact test of table symmetry. CAUTION:  the exact test
    requires substantial amounts of time and memory for large tables.
