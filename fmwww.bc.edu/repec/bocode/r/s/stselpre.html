Fits proportional hazards model to case-cohort data
---------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^stselpre^ varlist [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [^, nohr^ ^l^evel^(^#^)^ ^self^
               {^bre^slow | ^efr^on | ^exactm^ | ^exactp^} ^nosh^ow  ^force^ ]
<p>
<p>
^stselpre^ is for use with survival-time data; see help @st@. Before using the 
&gt; command,
data must be prepared for case-cohort analysis by ^stcascoh^; see help @stcasco
&gt; h@.
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^stselpre^ returns estimates and standard errors from proportional hazards fit 
&gt; to
case-cohort data. Coefficients are estimated according to two methods:
<p>
- Self-Prentice scheme. Risk sets uses just the sub-cohort member at risk,
- Prentice scheme. Risk sets are augmented by non sub-cohort cases when they fa
&gt; il.
<p>
The asymptotic Self-Prentice method variance-covariance matrix and standard err
&gt; ors are
computed using the simplification  described in Therneau and Li (1999).
<p>
The syntax of @predict@ following ^stselpre^ is as in ^stcox^
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^nohr^ specifies that coefficients rather than hazard ratios are to be displaye
&gt; d 
    ^nohr^ may be typed at estimation or when replaying previously estimated re
&gt; sults.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level for the confidence intervals of the
    coefficients; see help @level@. ^level^ may be also specified when replayin
&gt; g previously
    estimated results.
<p>
^self^ specifies that Self-Prentice method coefficient vector is to be saved in
&gt;  e(b).
    Prentice method coefficients are saved by default. 
<p>
^breslow^, ^efron^, ^exactm^, and ^exactp^ each specify a method for handling t
&gt; ied
    deaths that the underlying ^stcox^ command executes. ^efron^ is the default
&gt; .
<p>
^noshow^ prevents ^stselpre^ from displaying the identities of the key st varia
&gt; bles
    above its output.
<p>
^force^ prevents ^stselpre^ from doing some check on the data set previously pr
&gt; epared by ^stcascoh^.
