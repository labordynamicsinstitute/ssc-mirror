<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>svrset</b> sets the key variables for use by replication-based survey analysis
routines (see svr and survwgt).
<p>
The <b>survwgt</b> command can be used to create replication weights for use with the
<b>svr</b> programs; it will set these options automatically when it generates
weights.  The {svrset} command is for use with datasets that come with
replication weights already calculated.
<p>
You must specify these options using <b>svrset</b> or have them set automatically by
<b>survwgt</b>; you cannot specify them a part of a <b>svr</b> command.
<p>
Note that if you set more than one option with {svrset set}, you must enclose
any values with multiple words in quotation marks, so they are understood as a
single value to be set.
<p>
Once you specifiy these options, they will be remembered if you save your data.
<p>
All of the current settings can be reviewed by typing <b>svrset list</b> without
arguments:
<p>
        . svrset list
<p>
Settings can be changed simply by setting a different value.
<p>
Settings can be erased using the <b>clear</b> subcommand.  You must explicitly clear
old settings.
<p>
        . svrset clear rw
<p>
To clear all settings, type
<p>
        . svrset clear
<p>
<p>
<b><u>The key survey replication variables</u></b>
<p>
<b>svrset set meth</b> specifies the replication method to be used to calculate
    (co)variances of estimates.  The available options are brr, jk1, jk2, and
    jkn.  See survwgt for information on the various methods.
<p>
<b>svrset set pw</b> specifies the name of a numeric variable that contains the full
    sample weighting variable (i.e., the full sample pweight.
<p>
<b>svrset set rw</b> specifies a numeric varlist that contains the replication
    weights.
<p>
<b>svrset set dof</b> sets the degrees of freedom for variance estimates.
<p>
<b>svrset set fay</b> sets the constant to be used in Fay's variant of the BRR method.
    This option is not valid with other methods, and will be set to zero
    automatically.
<p>
<b>svrset set psun</b> sets the number of PSUs in each stratum, for use with the jkn
    method.  This method requires this information for the proper calculation
    of variance estimates.  There must be one number set for each replicate.
    Thus, a design involving two strata, with two PSUs in the first stratum and
    three PSUs in the second, would have psun set to "2 2 3 3 3".
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
        . svrset set pw mainwgt rw "rep1 rep2 rep3 rep4 rep5"
<p>
            This would set the main analysis weight to "mainwgt", and specify
            five sets of replication weights, "rep1" through "rep5".
<p>
        . svrset set meth brr
<p>
        . svrset list
<p>
        . svrset clear rw
