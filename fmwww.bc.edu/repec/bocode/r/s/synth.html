<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>synth</b> implements the synthetic control method for causal inference in
    comparative case studies. <b>synth</b> estimates the effect of an intervention
    of interest by comparing the evolution of an aggregate outcome <i>depvar</i> for
    a unit affected by the intervention to the evolution of the same
    aggregate outcome for a synthetic control group. <b>synth</b> constructs this
    synthetic control group by searching for a weighted combination of
    control units chosen to approximate the unit affected by the intervention
    in terms of the outcome predictors.  The evolution of the outcome for the
    resulting synthetic control group is an estimate of the counterfactual of
    what would have been observed for the affected unit in the absence of the
    intervention. <b>synth</b> can also be used to conduct a variety of placebo and
    permutation tests that produce informative inference regardless of the
    number of available comparison units and the number of available
    time-periods. See Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and
    Hainmueller (2010) for details.
<p>
<b><u>Required Settings</u></b>
<p>
<a name="predoptions"></a>    <b>depvar</b> the outcome variable.
<p>
    <b>predictorvars</b> the list of predictor variables. By default, all predictor
        variables are averaged over the entire pre-intervention period, which
        ranges from the earliest time period available in the panel time
        variable specified in<b> tsset</b> <i>timevar</i> to the period immediately prior
        to the intervention specified in<b> trperiod</b>. Missing values are ignored
        in the averages.
 
        The user has two options to flexibly specify the time periods over
        which predictors are averaged:
<p>
          (1)<b> xperiod</b>(<i>numlist</i>) allows to specify a common period over which
          all predictors should be averaged; see below for details.
<p>
          (2) For each particular predictor the user can specify the period
          over which the variable will be averaged. For this,<b> synth</b> uses a
          specialized syntax.  The time period is specified in parenthesis
          directly following the variable name, e.g. varname(<i>period</i>) with no
          blanks between the variable name and its <i>period</i>. <i>period</i> can contain
          either a single period, a numlist of periods, or several periods
          concatenated by a "&amp;".  The periods refer to the panel time
          variable specified in<b> tsset</b> <i>timevar</i>. For example, assume the time
          periods are given in years, and there are four predictors X1, X2,
          X3, and X4 then:
<p>
          <b>. synth Y X1(1980) X2(1982&amp;1986&amp;1988) X3(1980(1)1990) X4</b>
<p>
          indicates that:
            <b>X1(1980)</b>: the value of the variable X1 in the year 1980 is
            entered as a predictor.
<p>
            <b>X2(1982&amp;1986&amp;1988)</b>: the value of the variable X2 averaged over
            the years 1982, 1986, and 1988 is entered as a predictor.
<p>
            <b>X3(1980(1)1990)</b>: the value of the variable X3 averaged over the
            years 1980,1981,...,1990 is entered as a predictor.
<p>
            <b>X4</b>: since no variable specific period is provided, the value of
            the variable X4 is averaged either over the entire pretreatment
            period (default) or the period specified in<b> xperiod</b>(<i>numlist</i>) and
            then entered as a predictor.
<p>
    <b>trunit</b>(<i>#</i>) the unit number of the unit affected by the intervention as
        given in the panel id variable specified in<b> tsset</b> <i>panelvar</i>; see 
        tsset. Notice that only a single unit number can be specified. If the
        intervention of interest affected several units the user may chose to
        combine these units first and then treat them as a single unit
        affected by the intervention.
<p>
    <b>trperiod</b>(<i>#</i>) the time period when the intervention occurred. The time
        period refers to the panel time variable specified in<b> tsset</b> <i>timevar</i>;
        see tsset. Only a single number can be specified.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>counit</b>(<i>numlist</i>) a list of unit numbers for the control units as given in
        the panel id variable specified in<b> tsset</b> <i>panelvar</i>; see tsset.
        <b>counit()</b> should be specified as a list of integer numbers (see 
        numlist) and contain at least two control units.  The list of control
        units specified constitute what is called the `donor pool', the set
        of potential control units out of which the synthetic control unit is
        constructed.  Notice that<b> counit</b> is optional, if no<b> counit</b> is
        specified, the donor pool defaults to all units available in the
        panel id variable specified in<b> tsset</b>, excluding the unit affected by
        the intervention specified in<b> trunit</b>.
<p>
    <b>xperiod</b>(<i>numlist</i>) a list of time periods over which the predictor
        variables specified in <i>predictorvars</i> are averaged. The list of time
        periods refers to the panel time variable specified in<b> tsset</b> <i>timevar</i>.
        For example, if the specified panel time variable is given in years,
        <b>xperiod</b>(1980(1)1988) indicates that the predictor variables are
        averaged over all years from 1980, 1981,...,1988. See numlist on how
        to specify lists of numbers.
 
        If no<b> xperiod</b> is specified,<b> xperiod</b> defaults to the entire
        pre-intervention period, which by default ranges from the earliest
        time period available in the panel time variable to the period
        immediately prior to the intervention. Notice that the period of the
        intervention itself is excluded from the average and missing entries
        are ignored.  Also notice that variable-specific time periods always
        take precedence over<b> xperiod</b>.  Usually,<b> xperiod</b> is specified to
        contain a number of pre-intervention periods, although
        post-intervention time periods could be included if the predictors
        are not affected by the intervention.
<p>
    <b>mspeperiod</b>(<i>numlist</i>) a list of pre-intervention time periods over which
        the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) should be minimized. The
        list of time periods refers to the panel time variable specified in
        <b>tsset</b> <i>timevar</i>; see tsset. The MSPE refers to the squared deviations
        between the outcome for the treated unit and the synthetic control
        unit summed over all pre-intervention periods specified in
        <i>mspeperiod(numlist)</i>. See numlist on how to specify lists of numbers.
        If no<b> mspeperiod()</b> is specified,<b> mspeperiod()</b> defaults to the entire
        pre-intervention period ranging from the earliest time period
        available in the panel time variable to the period immediately prior
        to the intervention. Notice that the period of the intervention
        itself is excluded from<b> mspeperiod()</b>.  Usually, the<b> mspeperiod()</b> is
        specified to cover the whole pre-treatment period up to the time of
        the intervention, but other choices are possible.
<p>
<p>
    <b>resultsperiod</b>(<i>numlist</i>) a list of time periods over which the results of
        <b>synth</b> should be obtained in the optional figure (see<b> figure</b>), the
        optional results dataset (see <b>keep</b>), and the return matrices (see
        <b>ereturn results</b>)). The list of time periods refers to the panel time
        variable specified in<b> tsset</b> <i>timevar</i>.  If no<b> resultsperiod</b> is
        specified,<b> resultsperiod</b> defaults to the entire period, which by
        default ranges from the earliest to the latest time period available
        in the panel time variable.
<p>
    <b>nested</b> by default<b> synth</b> uses a data-driven regression based method to
        obtain the variable weights contained in the V-matrix. This method
        relies on a constrained quadratic programming routine, that finds the
        best fitting W-weights conditional on the regression based V-matrix.
        This procedure is fast and often yields satisfactory results in terms
        of minimizing the MSPE.  Specifying <b>nested</b> will lead to better
        performance, however, at the expense of additional computing time.
        If <b>nested</b> is specified <b>synth</b> embarks on an fully nested optimization
        procedure that searches among all (diagonal) positive semidefinite
        V-matrices and sets of W-weights for the best fitting convex
        combination of the control units.  The fully nested optimization
        contains the regression based V as a starting point, but often
        produces convex combinations that achieve even lower MSPE. If<b> customV</b>
        is specified and<b> nested</b> is specified, the user supplied V-matrix form
        the starting point for the nested optimization.  All parameters of
        both optimizers can be tuned by the user depending on his application
        (see <i>optimset</i>).
<p>
    <b>allopt</b> if nested is specified (see <b>nested</b>) the user can also specify
        <b>allopt</b> if she is willing to trade-off even more computing time in
        order to gain fully robust results. Sometimes the search space may
        contain local minima such that the nested optimization procedure
        starting from the regression based V-matrix may not find the global
        minimum in the parameter space.<b>  allopt</b> provides a robustness check
        by running the nested optimization three times using three different
        starting points (the regression based V, equal V-weights, and a third
        procedure that uses Stata's ml search procedure to find good starting
        values.<b>  synth</b> returns the best result of all three attempts. This
        option usually will take three times the amount of computing time
        compared to the<b> nested</b> option.  Often<b> allopt</b> will lead to no
        improvement over just the<b> nested</b> method, but sometime<b> allopt</b> produces
        even better results.
<p>
    <b>unitnames</b>(<i>varname</i>) a string variable that contains unit names. The unit
        names refer to the unit numbers in the panel id variable specified in
        <b>tsset</b> <i>pvar</i>; see tsset. If<b> unitnames</b> is provided the results will be
        displayed with unit numbers labeled by their respective unit names.
        So for example, if the user has two variables in his dataset called
        country_numbers (numeric) and country_names (string),
        <b>unitnames(country_names)</b> could be specified to display the results
        using country names instead of numbers. Alternatively, if the user
        does not specify<b> unitnames</b>, but his panel id variable is labeled, the
        labels from the latter will be used.
<p>
    <b>figure</b> if specified <b>synth</b> produces a line plot with outcome trends for
        the treated unit and the synthetic control unit for the years
        specified in <i>resultsperiod()</i>.
<p>
    <b>keep(</b><i>filename</i><b>)</b> saves a dataset with the results in the file<i> filename</i><b>.dta</b>.
        This dataset can be used to further process the results.
<p>
        If <b>keep(</b><i>filename</i><b>)</b> is specified, <i>filename</i><b>.dta</b> will hold the following
        variables:
<p>
        <b>_time:</b>
            A variable that contains the respective time period
            (from the<b> tsset</b> panel time variable (<i>timevar</i>)) for
            all periods specified in <i>resultsperiod()</i>.
<p>
        <b>_Y_treated:</b>
            The observed outcome <i>depvar</i> for the treated unit
            specified in <i>tr()</i> for each time period specified in
            <i>resultsperiod()</i>.
<p>
        <b>_Y_synthetic:</b>
            The estimated outcome <i>depvar</i> for the synthetic
            control unit estimated using the convex combination
            of the control units specified in <i>co()</i> for each time
            period specified in <i>resultsperiod()</i>.
<p>
        <b>_Co_Number:</b>
            A variable that contains the unit number (from the
            <b>tsset</b> panel unit variable (<i>panelvar</i>) for each
            control unit specified in <i>co()</i>. If unit names are
            supplied via <i>conames()</i> the unit numbers will be
            labeled accordingly (each control unit number is
            labeled with its respective name from <i>conames()</i>.
<p>
        <b>_W_weight:</b>
            A variable that contains the estimated unit weight
            for each control units specified in <i>co()</i>.
<p>
    <b>replace</b> replaces the dataset specified in <b>keep(</b><i>filename</i><b>)</b> if it already
        exists.
<p>
    <b>customV</b>(<i>numlist</i>) by default<b> synth</b> uses a data-driven regression based
        method to obtain the variable weights contained in the V-matrix.
        <b>customV</b>() gives the user the option to supply custom V-Weights
        instead.  Notice that the V-weights determine the predictive power of
        the respective variable for the outcome of interest over the
        pre-intervention period. Highly predictive variables should be given
        a high weight, so that the unit affected by the intervention and the
        synthetic control unit match strongly on this predictor.  Weights are
        specified as a list with weights appearing in the same order as the
        predictors listed in <i>predictorvars</i>.  One weight must be supplied for
        each predictor. See the papers in the references for details. For
        now, only one weight per variable is allowed (the V matrix is
        diagonal), but future releases will allow non-diagonal V matrices to
        be supplied.

<b><u>Optimization Settings:</u></b>
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control parameters for the <i> constrained quadratic optimization routine</i>:
<p>
     The constrained quadratic optimization routine is based on an algorithm
     that uses the interior point method to solve the constrained quadratic
     programming problem (see Vanderbei 1999 for more details on the interior
     point method).  It is implemented via a C++ plugin and has the following
     tuning parameters:
<p>
        <b>margin(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> Margin for constraint violation tolerance. Default is 5
        percent (ie. 0.05).
        <b>maxiter(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> Maximum number of iterations. Default is 1000.
        <b>sigf(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> Precision (no of significant figures). Default is 7.
        <b>bound(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> Clipping bound for the variables. Default is 10.
<p>
<p>
Additional control parameters for the <i> nested optimization routine</i>:
<p>
     If<b> nested</b> is specified, a nested optimization will be performed using
     the constrained quadratic programming routine and Stata's ml optimizer.
     By default,<b> synth</b> uses the maximize default settings. The user may tune
     the maximize settings depending on his application (e.g. like synth ...
     , iterate(20) ).
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
<b><u>Saved Results</u></b>
<p>
    By default, <b>synth</b> ereturns the following matrices, which can be displayed
        by typing<b> ereturn list</b> after<b> synth</b> is finished (also see ereturn).
<p>
        <b>e(V_matrix):</b>
          A diagonal matrix that contains the normalized variable weights in
          the diagonal.
<p>
        <b>e(X_balance) :</b>
          A matrix that juxtaposes the predictor values for the unit affected
          by the intervention and the synthetic control unit. The matrix has
          two columns (treated and synthetic) and as many rows as predictors.
<p>
        <b>e(W_weights) :</b>
          A matrix that contains the unit numbers and unit weights, ie. the
          relative contribution of each control unit to the synthetic control
          unit.  The matrix has two column and as many rows as control units.
<p>
        <b>e(Y_treated) :</b>
          A matrix that contains the values of the response variable for the
          treated unit for each time period.  The matrix has one column and
          as many rows as time periods specified in <b>resultsperiod()</b>.
<p>
        <b>e(Y_synthetic) :</b>
          A matrix that contains the values of the response variable for the
          synthetic control unit for each time period.  The matrix has one
          column and as many rows as time periods specified in
          {cmd:resultsperiod().
<p>
        <b>e(RMSPE) :</b>
          A one by one matrix that contains the Root Mean Squared Prediction
          Error (RMSPE)}.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    Load Example Data: This panel dataset contains information for 39 US
        States for the years 1970-2000 (see Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller
        (2010) for details).
    . sysuse smoking
<p>
    Declare the dataset as panel:
    . tsset state year
<p>
    Example 1 - Construct synthetic control group:
    synth cigsale beer(1984(1)1988) lnincome retprice age15to24 cigsale(1988)
        cigsale(1980) cigsale(1975), trunit(3) trperiod(1989)
<p>
        In this example, the unit affected by the intervention is unit no 3
        (California) in the year 1989.  The donor pool (since no<b> counit()</b> is
        specified) defaults to the control units 1,2,4,5,...,39 ( ie. the
        other 38 states in the dataset).  Since no<b> xperiod()</b> is provided, the
        predictor variables for which no variable specific time period is
        specified (retprice, lnincome, and age15to24) are averaged over the
        entire pre-intervention period up to the year of the intervention
        (1970,1981,...,1988).  The beer variable has the time period
        (1984(1)1988) specified, meaning that it is averaged for the periods
        1984,1985,...,1988. The variable cigsale will be used three times as
        a predictor using the values from periods 1988, 1980, and 1975
        respectively.  The MSPE is minimized over the entire pretreatment
        period, because<b> mspeperiod()</b> is not provided. By default, results are
        displayed for the period from 1970,1971,...,2000 period (the earliest
        and latest year in the dataset).
<p>
    Example 2 - Construct synthetic control group:
    synth cigsale beer lnincome(1980&amp;1985) retprice cigsale(1988)
        cigsale(1980) cigsale(1975), trunit(3) trperiod(1989) fig
<p>
        This example is similar to example 1, but now beer is averaged over
        the entire pretreatment period while lnincome is only averaged over
        the periods 1980 and 1985.  Since no data is available for beer prior
        to 1984,<b> synth</b> will inform the user that there is missing data for
        this variable and that the missing values are ignored in the
        averaging. A results figure is also requested using the<b> fig</b> option.
<p>
    Example 3 - Construct synthetic control group:
    synth cigsale retprice cigsale(1970) cigsale(1979) , trunit(33)
        counit(1(1)20) trperiod(1980) fig resultsperiod(1970(1)1990)
<p>
        In this example, the unit affected by the intervention is state no
        33, and the donor pool of potential control units is restricted to
        states no 1,2,...,20.  The intervention occurs in 1980, and results
        are obtained for the 1970,1971,...,1990 period.
<p>
    Example 4 - Construct synthetic control group:
    synth cigsale retprice cigsale(1970) cigsale(1979) , trunit(33)
        counit(1(1)20) trperiod(1980) resultsperiod(1970(1)1990) keep(resout)
<p>
        This example is similar to example 2 but<b> keep(resout)</b> is specified
        and thus<b> synth</b> will save a dataset named resout.dta in the current
        Stata working directory (type<b> pwd</b> to see the path of your working
        directory). This dataset contains the result from the current fit and
        can be used for further processing. Also to easily access results
        recall that<b> synth</b> routinely returns all result matrices. These can be
        displayed by typing<b> ereturn list</b> after <b>synth</b> has terminated.
<p>
    Example 5 - Construct synthetic control group:
    synth cigsale beer lnincome retprice age15to24 cigsale(1988)
        cigsale(1980) cigsale(1975) , trunit(3) trperiod(1989)
        xperiod(1980(1)1988) nested
<p>
        This is again example 2, but the<b> nested</b> option is specified, which
        may produce lower loss at the expense of additional computing time.
        Also,<b> xperiod()</b> is specified indicating that predictors are averaged
        for the 1980,1981,...,1988 period.
<p>
    Example 5 – Run placebo in space:
    <b>. tempname resmat</b>
        <b>forvalues i = 1/4 {</b>
        <b>synth cigsale retprice cigsale(1988) cigsale(1980) cigsale(1975) ,</b>
        <b>trunit(`i') trperiod(1989) xperiod(1980(1)1988)</b>
        <b>matrix `resmat' = nullmat(`resmat') \ e(RMSPE)</b>
        <b>local names `"`names' `"`i'"'"'</b>
        <b>}</b>
        <b>mat colnames `resmat' = "RMSPE"</b>
        <b>mat rownames `resmat' = `names'</b>
        <b>matlist `resmat' , row("Treated Unit")</b>
<p>
        This is a code example to run placebo studies by iteratively
        reassigning the intervention in space to the first four states. To do
        so, we simply run a four loop each where the <b>trunit()</b> setting is
        incremented in each iteration. Thus, in the first run of<b> synth</b> state
        number one is assigned to the intervention, in the second run state
        number two, etc, etc. In each run we store the RMSPE and display it
        in a matrix at the end.
