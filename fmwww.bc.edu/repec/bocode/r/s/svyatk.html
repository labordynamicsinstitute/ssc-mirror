<b>svyatk</b> typed without arguments redisplays the last estimates.  The level option
may be used.
<p>
The survey design variables must be set beforehand by <b>svyset</b>, see help svyset.
<p>
Warning:  Use of <b>if</b> or <b>in</b> restrictions will not produce correct variance
estimates for subpopulations in many cases.  To compare estimates for
subpopulations, use the <b>subpop()</b> option.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>svyatk</b> provides estimates of finite-population Atkinson inequality indices,
together with their associated variance estimates. The Atkinson class of
inequality indices, A(e), is characterized by a sensitivity parameter, e
(`epsilon'), where e &gt; 0.  The program calculates A(e) for e = 0.5, 1, 1.5, and
2, and for one additional value (which defaults to e = 2.5, unless set
otherwise using the <b>epsilon</b> option). The larger that e is, the more sensitive
that A(e) becomes to differences at the bottom of the distribution of <i>varname</i>.
<p>
Sampling variances are calculated using a method proposed by Woodruff (1971).
The derivations assume that the sample under consideration is sufficiently
large that a Taylor series approximation to the index holds. For full details
of the derivation of the sampling variances, see Biewen and Jenkins (2003).
<p>
The program may also be used to calculate sampling variances in the case where
there are i.i.d. observations: see Biewen and Jenkins (2003).
<p>
A companion program, <b>svygei</b>, provides estimates of Generalized Entropy
inequality indices, using the same methods.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>epsilon</b> allows the user to choose a value of e (default = 2.5).
<p>
<b>subpop(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies that estimates be computed for the single
    subpopulation defined by the observations for which <i>varname</i>!=0.  Typically,
    <i>varname</i>=1 defines the subpopulation and <i>varname</i>=0 indicates observations
    not belonging to the subpopulation.  For observations whose subpopulation
    status is uncertain, varname should be set to missing.

            with obs = individual

            with obs = individual
<p>
        . * weight = individual sample weight; survey PSU and strata not
            provided; household ID known

<p>
        . * (3) Income inequality among individuals using survey data with obs
            = household;
