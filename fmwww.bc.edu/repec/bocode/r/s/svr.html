<b><u>Introduction to survey replication commands</u></b>
<p>
The prefix <b>svr</b> stands for SurVey Replication, and refers to commands that
analyze complex survey data using replication methods.  The available methods
are balanced repeated replication (BRR), and several versions of survey
jackknife (JK1, JK2, and JKn).  These methods are an alternative to the Taylor
series linearization methods available in Stata's svy commands.  See survwgt
for details on replication methods.
<p>
<p>
Basic <b>svr</b> commands:
<p>
    help survwgt       Creates sets of replication weights for <b>svr</b> analysis.
                       Also performs other transformations on survey sampling
                       weights, including post-stratification, raking, and
                       non-response adjustments.
<p>
    help svrset        Set variables for replication-based analysis of survey
                       data
<p>
<p>
Estimation commands:
<p>
    help svrmodel        Linear regression and other regression-type models
<p>
    help svrmean       Estimation of population and subpopulation means
    help svrratio      Estimation of population and subpopulation ratios
    help svrtotal      Estimation of population and subpopulation totals
<p>
    help svrtab        Two-way tables for survey data
<p>
    help svrcorr       Estimation of correlation coefficients
<p>
    help svrest        Calculation of replication-based (co)variances for other
                       commands
<p>
<p>
Post-estimation commands:
<p>
    The <b>svr</b> commands have been written such that Stata's <b>svy</b> post-estimation
                       commands function:
<p>
    help svylc         Estimate linear combinations of parameters (e.g.,
                       differences of means, regression coefficients)
<p>
    help svytest       Hypotheses tests for survey data
<p>
    help svresttest    Hypotheses tests involving the statistics calculated by
                       <b>svrest</b>
