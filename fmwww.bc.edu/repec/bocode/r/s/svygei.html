<b><u>Estimation of GE inequality indices from complex survey data</u></b>

<b>svygei</b> typed without arguments redisplays the last estimates.  The level option
may be used.
<p>
The survey design variables must be set beforehand by <b>svyset</b>, see help svyset.
<p>
Warning:  Use of <b>if</b> or <b>in</b> restrictions will not produce correct variance
estimates for subpopulations in many cases.  To compare estimates for
subpopulations, use the <b>subpop()</b> option.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>svygei</b> provides estimates of finite-population Generalised Entropy (GE)
inequality indices, together with their associated variance estimates. The GE
class of inequality indices is characterized by a sensitivity parameter, a. The
program calculates GE(a) for a = -1 and 2 plus the limiting cases when a -&gt; 0
(the mean logarithmic deviation, MLD) and when a -&gt; 1 (the Theil index), and
for one additional value (which defaults to a = 3, unless set otherwise using
the <b>alpha</b> option).  GE(2) is half the square of the coefficient of variation.
The indices differ in their sensitivities to differences in different parts of
the distribution of <i>varname</i>. The more positive that a is, the more sensitive
GE(a) is to differences at the top of the distribution of varname; the more
negative that a is, the more sensitive it is to differences at the bottom of
the distribution of <i>varname</i>.
<p>
Sampling variances are calculated using a method proposed by Woodruff (1971).
The derivations assume that the sample under consideration is sufficiently
large that a Taylor series approximation to the index holds. For full details
of the derivation of the sampling variances, see Biewen and Jenkins (2003).
<p>
The program may also be used to calculate sampling variances in the case where
there are i.i.d. observations: see Biewen and Jenkins (2003).
<p>
A companion program, <b>svyatk</b>, provides estimates of Atkinson inequality indices,
using the same methods.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>alpha</b> allows the user to choose a value of a (default = 3).
<p>
<b>subpop(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> specifies that estimates be computed for the single
    subpopulation defined by the observations for which <i>varname</i>!=0.  Typically,
    <i>varname</i>=1 defines the subpopulation and <i>varname</i>=0 indicates observations
    not belonging to the subpopulation.  For observations whose subpopulation
    status is uncertain, <i>varname</i> should be set to missing.

            with obs = individual

        . svygei income
<p>
        . * (2) Income inequality among individuals using household survey data
            with obs = individual
<p>
        . * weight = individual sample weight; survey PSU and strata not
            provided; household ID known

<p>
        . * (3) Income inequality among individuals using survey data with obs
            = household;
<p>
        . * all persons in same household have same income; survey PSU and
            strata not provided
<p>
        . * weight = household weight x household size
<p>
        . use income_hh, clear
