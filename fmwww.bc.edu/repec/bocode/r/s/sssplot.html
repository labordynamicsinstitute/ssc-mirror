Seasonal subseries plot (month plot or cycle plot)
--------------------------------------------------

Description
-----------
<p>
^sssplot^ produces a graph of datavar by monthvar and yearvar. In
practice datavar may be raw data or the seasonal component of such data.
<p>
The descriptors monthvar and yearvar are used for concreteness. The plot
may be useful whenever periods (e.g. years) are divided into a fixed
number of shorter periods (e.g. months, quarters).
<p>
monthvar by default should be a variable taking on values 1,...,12 for
the 12 months. The data are sorted by month and then by year, so that
the series is split into 12 monthly subseries.
<p>
However, if the ^f()^ option is used, monthvar should be a variable
taking on values 1,...,^f^. The data are in that case plotted as ^f^
subseries.
<p>
Hereafter, for `month' and for `year' read strictly `shorter period' and
`longer period'.
<p>
The data are also sorted so that ^c(L)^ can be used to connect data
points, without connections across periods with missing values. ^c(l)^
is not advised as a consequence.
<p>
Terminology for this plot is not stable. See notes with References.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^start(^#^)^ indicates the first month plotted on the x axis. Default 1.
    This option may be used whenever there is some better natural start
    to the year than (say) January.
<p>
^sf(^string^)^ calculates a summary function to be shown for each month.
    The summary function may be any function acceptable to ^egen^ that
    has syntax like
<p>
    ^egen^ newvar = ^mean(^datavar^), by(^monthvar^)^
<p>
    ^mean^ and ^median^ are the most obvious possibilities.
<p>
    If ^sf^ is used, two variables -- the data and the summary -- are
    plotted on the y axis. Graph options such as ^c( )^ and ^sy( )^
    should be specified accordingly. The defaults are ^c(.L) sy(oi)^.
<p>
^la(^string^)^ gives labels for the months. Default ^Jan^ ... ^Dec^ for
    ^f^ = 12 and ^JFM AMJ JAS OND^ for ^f^ = 4. Labels should be
    separated by spaces. They should be specified in the sort order of
    monthvar, that is before the rotation implied by ^start^ other than 1.
<p>
^gbym^ indicates that graphs are to be shown separately for each month.
    Year is on the x axis.
<p>
^f(^#^)^ indicates that data are for # shorter periods within each
    longer period.
<p>
graph_options are options allowed with ^graph, twoway^.
<p>
