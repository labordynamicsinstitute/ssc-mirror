<b><u>Store and repeat commands using characteristics</u></b>
<p>
        <b>storecmd</b> <i>charname cmdline</i>
<p>
        <b>stowcmd</b> <i>charname cmdline</i>
<p>
        <b>repcmd</b> <i>charname</i> [ <b>,</b> <b><u>s</u></b><b>howonly</b> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <i>cmdline</i> is any Stata command line.
<p>
    <i>charname</i> is the name of a Stata characteristic. To avoid confusion with
    characteristics used by Stata itself, include at least one capital letter
    in the name.
<p>
    <b>storecmd</b> executes <i>cmdline</i>. If successful, meaning that there were no
    errors, <i>cmdline</i> is stored as characteristic <b>_dta[</b><i>charname</i><b>]</b>.
<p>
    <b>stowcmd</b> stows away <i>cmdline</i> as characteristic <b>_dta[</b><i>charname</i><b>]</b>.  <i>cmdline</i>
    therefore need not be a command that would execute properly at the time
    it is stowed.
<p>
    <b>repcmd</b> executes the command stored in characteristic <b>_dta[</b><i>charname</i><b>]</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>showonly</b> shows the command line stored, but does not execute it.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    Stata command lines are stored temporarily in memory and they may be
    stored as desired in text files, commonly <b>.log</b> or <b>.do</b> files.
<p>
    These commands offer a third possibility: command lines may be stored as
    characteristics. They may be stored within sessions, and so long as the
    data file is saved so that these characteristics are included, they may
    be stored between sessions with the same data file.
<p>
    Here is one pattern:
<p>
    1. You develop a complicated command line, possibly after several steps.
    You want to store it. Type, for example,
<p>
    <b>. storecmd G graph</b> &lt;complicated details&gt;
<p>
    The command line
<p>
    <b>graph</b> &lt;complicated details&gt;
<p>
    is executed.
<p>
    If no error occurs, the command line is stored as characteristic <b>_dta[G]</b>.
<p>
    In addition, the command line is placed in the keyboard buffer, so that
    it can be retrieved for editing.
<p>
    <b>storecmd G graph</b> &lt;complicated details&gt;
<p>
    is one line above in the buffer.
<p>
    2. At any time, to see what commands have been stored, you can type
<p>
    <b>. char list</b>
<p>
    or
<p>
    <b>. char list _dta</b>
<p>
    noting that this will list any other characteristics as well.
<p>
    3. If you wish to save such characteristics with the data file, use the
    <b>save</b> command.
<p>
    4. Later, you wish to repeat the command. Type
<p>
    <b>. repcmd G</b>
<p>
    The command line stored as characteristic <b>_dta[G]</b> is executed.
<p>
    In addition, that command line is placed in the keyboard buffer, so that
    it can be retrieved for editing.
<p>
    <b>repcmd G</b>
<p>
    is one line above in the buffer.
