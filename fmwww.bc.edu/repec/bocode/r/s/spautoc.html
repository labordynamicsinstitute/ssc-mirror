<b><u>Description</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>spautoc</b> calculates Moran and Geary measures of spatial autocorrelation
    for a spatial variable <i>xvar</i> and neighbourhood information given by
    <i>neivar</i>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
                                                   
    For n values of a spatial variable x defined for various locations, which
    might be points or areas, calculate the deviations
<p>
            _
    z = x - x 
<p>
    and for pairs of locations i and j, define a weights matrix
<p>
    W = ( w   )
           ij 
          
    describing which locations are neighbours in some precise sense.  For
    example, a weight might be assigned as 1 if i and j are contiguous areas
    and 0 otherwise; or it might be a function of the distance between i and
    j and/or the length of boundary shared by i and j.
<p>
    The Moran measure of autocorrelation is
<p>
         n   n                      n   n         n   2
    n ( SUM SUM z  w   z  ) / ( 2 (SUM SUM w  )  SUM z  ) 
        i=1 j=1  i  ij  j          i=1 j=1  ij   i=1  i 
<p>
    and the Geary measure of autocorrelation is
<p>
               n   n               2           n   n         n   2
    (n - 1) ( SUM SUM w   (z  - z )  ) / ( 4 (SUM SUM w  )  SUM z  ) 
              i=1 j=1  ij   i    j            i=1 j=1  ij   i=1  i 
<p>
    and these measures may used to test the null hypothesis of no spatial
    autocorrelation, using both a sampling distribution assuming that x is
    normally distributed and a sampling distribution assuming randomisation,
    that is, we treat the data as one of n! assignments of the n values to
    the n locations.
<p>
    <b>spautoc</b> avoids the use of Stata's matrix language, to avoid any limit on
    the number of locations which that would imply, and to avoid the need to
    handle a matrix that would typically be very sparse. The price paid is a
    data structure for the neighbourhood information that is idiosyncratic by
    Stata standards.
<p>
    Here is a toy example:
<p>
    area            neighbours            value         
    ----            ----------            ----- 
      1             2, 3 and 4              3 
      2             1 and 4                 2
      3             1 and 4                 2
      4             1, 2 and 3              1
               
    This would be matched by the data
<p>
    <b>_n</b> (obs no)    <b>x</b> (numeric variable)    <b>nei</b> (string variable) 
    -----------    --------------------    --------------------- 
         1                   3                    "2 3 4"
         2                   2                      "1 4"
         3                   2                      "1 4"
         4                   1                    "1 2 3"
<p>
    That is, <b>nei</b> contains the observation numbers of the neighbours of the
    location in the current observation, separated by spaces. Therefore, the
    data must be in precisely this sort order when <b>spautoc</b> is called.
<p>
    Note various assumptions made here:
<p>
        1. The neighbourhood information can be fitted into at most a <b>str244</b>
        variable.
<p>
        2. If i neighbours j, then j also neighbours i and both facts are
        specified.
<p>
    By default this data structure implies that those locations listed have
    weights in W that are 1, while all other pairs of locations are not
    neighbours and have weights in W that are 0.
<p>
    If the weights in W are not binary (1 or 0), use the <b>weights()</b> option.
    The variable specified must be another string variable.
<p>
    <b>_n</b> (obs no)   <b>nei</b> (string variable)   <b>weight</b> (string variable)
    -----------   ---------------------   ------------------------
         1                "2 3 4"             ".1234 .5678 .9012"
    etc. 
<p>
    The weights matrix need not be symmetric.
<p>
    Again, the assumption here is that these weights can be fitted into at
    most a <b>str244</b> variable.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>weight()</b> specifies a string variable containing numeric weights, as
        explained above.
<p>
    <b>lmean()</b> and <b>lmedian()</b> specify that new variables should be generated
        containing local means and local medians, that is, means and medians
        of the neighbours of each location (not including that location). Any
        weights specified will be used in the calculation.
