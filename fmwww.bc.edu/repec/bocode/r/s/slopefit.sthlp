{syntab:Conditioning on covariates}
{synopt :{opt c:ontrols(varlist)}}Adjusts the relationship between {it:xvar} and {it:yvar} linearly for continuous covariates. Achieved by residualization.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt fc:ontrols(varlist)}}Controls for factor variables, i.e. categorical variables such as gender or region.{p_end}

{syntab:Regression parameters}
{synopt :{opt regp:arameters(str)}}Prints parameters into the plot. May contain {it:coef} for information on how the slope of {it:xvar} changes when {it:zvar} increases by one unit, {it:pval} for the associated p-value, {it:sig} for significance (*<.1, **<.05, ***<.001), and {it:nobs} for N.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt parp:os(numlist)}}Overrides the position of the parameters within the plot. For example, {opt parpos(0 5)} choses 0 as the y-coordinate and 5 as the x-coordinate.{p_end}

{syntab:Scatter points}
{synopt :{opt mw:eighted(num)}}Adjusts the marker size depending on the number of observations at distinct values of {it:yvar} and {it:xvar}. Useful with {opt discrete} and {opt unibin()}.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt ml:abel(var)}}Uses the strings / value labels stored in {it:var} as scatter markers instead of the usual circles, diamonds, etc.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt jit:ter(num)}}Randomly varies the location of scatter points.{p_end}

{syntab:Distribution of z variable}
{synopt :{opt zdistr:ibution(string)}}Adds a kernel density plot of {it:zvar}. May be set to {it:auto} or {it:a b}, where {it:a} contains the position and {it:b} the height of the density.{p_end}

{synopt :{opt cint:ensity(num)}}Changes the color intensity. Higher values make colors darker.{p_end}

{syntab:Plot and element size}

{synopt :{opt ms:ize(num)}}Resizes the scatter markers.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt pars:ize(num)}}Resizes the printed regression parameters.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt legs:ize(num)}}Resizes the legend.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt xys:ize(num)}}Specifies the relative width to height. For example, {opt xysize(1.2)} draws a plot with 20% more width than height.{p_end}

{syntab:Other}
{synopt :{opt stand:ardize}}Standardizes {it:xvar} and {it:yvar} to a standard deviation of one and a mean of zero.{p_end}
