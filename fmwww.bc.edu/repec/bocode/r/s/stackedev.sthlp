implements the stacked event study estimator discussed in Cunningham (2021) and Baker (2021) and implemented in Cengiz et al. (2010). The package appends together individual datasets or stacks. Each stack includes all observations from a cohort of units that receive treatment in the same time period and all units that never received treatment. Effects are identified within each stack by comparing an individual cohort of treated units to never treated units. That approach avoids erroneous comparisons of late to early implementing units that may bias Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) estimates if effects vary across treated cohorts (Goodman-Bacon, 2021). The stacked event study is estimated in three steps. First, individual stacks are created. Second, they are appended together. Finally the package estimates an event study via reghdfe that includes unit by stack fixed effects, time by stack fixed effects, and standard errors clustering on unit by stack.

where {it:leads_lags_list}} is the list of relative time indicators as you would have included in the canonical two-way fixed effects regression, for example:
{p_end} 
		[{it:post2}] [{it:post3}] [{it:post2}] [{it:post0}] [{it:post1}] [{it:post3}] [...]] 


{pstd}
Users should shape their dataset to a long format where each observation is at the unit-time level. See {help stackedev##examples:illustration} for an example of specifying the syntax. The syntax is similar to {helpb reghdfe} in specifying fixed effects (with {help reghdfe##opt_absorb:absorb}) 
and the type of standard error reported (with {help reghdfe##opt_vce:vcetype}). Results stored in e(b), e(V), and e(dof_table).

{opt stackedev} requires {helpb avar} (Baum and Schaffer, 2013), {helpb fools} (Correia, 2017), {helpb reghdfe} (Correia, 2017) to be installed.
Installation of {opt stackedev} will install {helpb avar}, {helpb ftools}, {helpb reghdfe} (and its dependencies) from ssc if necessary.
Installation of {opt eventstudyinteract} will install {helpb avar} and {helpb reghdfe} (and its dependencies) from ssc if necessary.
