<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    Schemes determine the overall look of a graph; see help for schemes.
<p>
    <b>rbn1mono</b> is Roger Newson's original personal default scheme.  It
    specifies a minimal and photocopier-friendly black-and-white look, with
    gray background lines and minimal gray shading.  It is slightly more
    minimal and photocopier-friendly than s1mono (which is its mother
    scheme), and slightly less minimal and photocopier-friendly than Svend
    Juul's lean schemes (which can be downloaded in their latest form using
    the findit command).  The plot area is framed as in the schemes s1color
    and s1mono.  The axis labels use value labels if these exist, and are
    perpendicular to the corresponding axis, so that they occupy a smaller
    and more predictable amount of axis space, instead of a larger and less
    predictable amount of axis space.  The default by-graph style is <b>compact</b>,
    to avoid wasting space.  The default number of columns in a legend is 1,
    to enable long and explicit labels.  The default spanning of titles is
    the whole graph region, not just the plot region.  Labels are
    right-justified.  The default size of most text, including titles,
    subtitles, notes and labels, is 3 percent of the minor axis dimension.
    The default width of most lines, including plot lines, grid lines and
    added <i>X</i>-axis and <i>Y</i>-axis lines, is 0.375 percent of the minor axis
    dimension.  The default clock position of marker labels is 3.  Any of
    these defaults can be overridden by the user.
<p>
    <b>rbn2mono</b> is Roger Newson's second personal default scheme.  It is an
    alternative version of <b>rbn1mono</b>, without the default scaling of text
    sizes, marker sizes and line widths used for by graphs, graph combine and
    graph matrix.  If the scheme <b>rbn2mono</b> is used, then these text sizes,
    marker sizes and line widths are the same, whether or not the user uses
    by graphs, graph combine and graph matrix.  The scheme <b>rbn1mono</b> inherits
    the scaling regime of s1mono when by graphs, graph combine and/or graph
    matrix are used.  This policy involves some complicated formulas, which
    may make it less easy for the user to estimate the correct relative size
    suboptions to specify.  For technical details of these formulas, see help
    for scaling for by graphs, graph combine, and graph matrix.
<p>
    <b>rbn3mono</b> is Roger Newson's third personal default scheme.  It is like
    <b>rbn1mono</b>, except that the default width of most lines, including plot
    lines, grid lines and added <i>X</i>-axis and <i>Y</i>-axis lines, is 0.25 percent of
    the minor axis dimension.
<p>
    <b>rbn4mono</b> is Roger Newson's fourth personal default scheme.  It is like
    <b>rbn2mono</b>, except that the default width of most lines, including plot
    lines, grid lines and added <i>X</i>-axis and <i>Y</i>-axis lines, is 0.25 percent of
    the minor axis dimension.
<p>
    The default line width of 0.375 percent of the minor dimension, used by
    <b>rbn1mono</b> and <b>rbn2mono</b>, was chosen to produce graphics for photocopying,
    and also for overhead projections, which should be visible to members of
    the audience with poor eyesight at the back of the hall.  The default
    line width of 0.25 percent of the minor dimension, used by <b>rbn3mono</b> and
    <b>rbn4mono</b>, is aimed to produce Figures for submission to medical
    periodicals, whose instructions to authors typically specify a preference
    for finer lines.  This is probably because most readers nowadays view
    them online, and can choose their own magnification.
