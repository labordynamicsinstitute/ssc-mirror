^sf36v2^ program
___________________
<p>
<p>
sf36v2 calculates the ^SF36 version 2 score^ (SF36) from your records
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; ----------
^DISCLAIMER^: 
Terms and Conditions for Using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey apply
In order to use the SF-36 Health Survey and scoring algorithms you must registe

Every effort is made to test code as thoroughly as possible but user must accep

Syntax: 
<p>
^sf36v2^ , acute ref(population) fsc(year) details suffix(text) 
<p>
^acute^ specifies that the data refer to acute (1 week recall) form of the SF36
&gt;  score 
        If this option is not specified, the score is used assuming that the da
&gt; ta have
        been collected using the standard (4 week recall) form
<p>
^ref(^population^)^ can be used to specify the reference population and year
                                        default reference population is US 1998
&gt; . The program supports
                                        US 1998 and JP 2002 reference populatio
&gt; ns 
                
^fsc(^year^) can be used to specify which factor score coefficients have to be 
&gt; used
             for the computation of the physical and mental component score. De
&gt; fault
                         coefficients are 1990 coefficients
<p>
^details^ will produce a table with the norms and factor score coeffients which
          have been used for the calculation                     
<p>
^suffix(^text^)^ allows use of suffixes to the variable names specified below
 
                  
Examples: 
<p>
^sf36v2^, ref(US 1998)  
^sf36v2^, acute d
^sf36v2^, ref(JP 2002) FCS(1995) suf(1y)                                       
&gt;              
<p>
<p>
Note:
The variables containing the information for the calculation need first to be 
named as defined below. Suffixes may be specified as wished (see options above)
&gt; . 
<p>
PF01-PF10: Physical Functioning Questions 1-10
RP01-RP04: Role-Physical Questions 1-4
BP01-BP02: Bodily Pain Questions 1-2
GH01-GH05: General Health Questions 1-5
VT01-VT04: Vitality Questions 1-4
SF01-SF02: Social Functioning Questions 1-2
RE01-RE03: Role-Emotional Questions 1-3
MH01-MH05: Mental Health Questions 1-5
HT: Reported Health Transition
<p>
<p>
Treatment of Missing Data:
A scale score is calculated if a respondent answered at least half of the items
&gt;  in 
a multi-item scale (or half plus one in case of odd nr. of items)
<p>
<p>

&gt; urvey.
