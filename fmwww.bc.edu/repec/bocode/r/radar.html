      <b>lw</b>(linewidthlist)    specifies a list of line widths for the

                            notes().

<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>radar</b> produces a radar plot from at least two variables. The first
    variable must always contain the label for the axes and the second
    variable must be numeric. For example the dataset below,
<p>
. list food level
     +----------------+
     |   food   level |
     |----------------|
  1. |   beer      12 |
  2. | crisps       5 |
  3. |  bread       3 |
  4. |    veg      44 |
  5. |  fruit       7 |
     +----------------+
<p>
    The axes of the radar plot will start at the top of the diagram and
    proceed in a clockwise direction. With the above dataset the first axes
    will be labelled beer.
<p>
    Missing values are included in the radar plot as gaps in the line joining
    observations.  This option is implemented using the <b>cmiss(</b><i>n</i><b>)</b> option of
    the twoway line graph, see help connect_options.

<p>
    <b>lc</b>(colorlist) specifies a list of colors for the observations (not axes).
<p>
    <b>lp</b>(patternlist) specifies a list of patterns for the observations (not
        axes).
<p>
    <b>lw</b>(linewidthlist) specifies a list of line widths for the observations
        (not axes).
<p>
    <b><u>r</u></b><b>label</b>(numlist) specifies the ticks and labels of the spokes. The default
        is to have 5 values displayed, note that the value that is the centre
        or smallest tick is suppressed but the value is included as a note
        below the graph. The note can be overwritten by using the<b> note()</b>
        option.
<p>
    twoway_options specifies additional twoway options, for example titles()
        and notes().
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    The examples below highlight the use of the <b>radar</b> plot on the Auto
    dataset. The only limitation is the number of "spokes" hence the commands
    are limited to just the foreign cars. Technical note: the limitation on
    the number of spokes is unknown because the limit is due to the size of
    macros being returned as part of a rclass program.
<p>
    Click below to load dataset
<p>
    sysuse auto
<p>
    Click below (after the dataset is loaded to see the distribution of
    weight for the foreign makes of car
<p>
    radar make weight if foreign
<p>
    Click below to see the distribution of turn mpg and trunk for each
    foreign make of car.
<p>
    radar make turn mpg trunk if foreign
    radar make turn mpg trunk if foreign, title(Nice Radar graph)
    radar make turn mpg trunk if foreign, title(Nice Radar graph) lc(red blue
        green) lp(dash dot dash_dot)
<p>
    radar make turn mpg trunk if foreign, title(Nice Radar graph) lc(red blue
        green) r(0 12 14 18 50)
<p>
    radar make turn mpg trunk if foreign, title(Nice Radar graph) lc(red blue
        green) lw(*1 *2 *4) r(0 12 14 18 50)
<p>
    There is no real advantage of a radar diagram compared to a scatter plot
    unless there was some sort of directional data.
