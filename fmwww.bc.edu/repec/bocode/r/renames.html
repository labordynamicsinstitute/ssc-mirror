Description
-----------
<p>
^renames^ renames one or more variables in memory. 
<p>
There are three syntaxes: 
<p>
^renames^ varlist ^\^ newvarlist renames each variable named in varlist 
by the corresponding name in newvarlist. 
<p>
^renames^ varlist^, prefix(^string^)^ renames each variable with its 
varname prefixed by the specified prefix string.
<p>
^renames^ varlist^, suffix(^string^)^ renames each variable with its 
varname suffixed by the specified suffix string. 
<p>
^renames^ will not rename any variable unless all the new names 
specified are acceptable as new variable names. 
<p>
Prefixed or suffixed variable names longer than 8 letters will not 
be truncated to 8 letters unless ^truncate^ is specified. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^prefix(^string^)^ specifies a prefix to be added to all varnames in varlist.
<p>
^suffix(^string^)^ specifies a suffix to be added to all varnames in varlist. 
<p>
^truncate^ specifies that prefixed or suffixed names that are too long 
    should be truncated.
