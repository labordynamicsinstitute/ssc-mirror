^ranova^ automatically checks for missing values across variables listed on
the command line. When a missing value is found in any variable, it 
deletes the variable from active memory. However, the original data set is 
restored to memory upon completition of the analysis. The program provides 
information regarding excluded observations.
<p>
The statistical design permits analysis of repeated (treatment) measures 
on the same individuals. Total model variability is divided into:
<p>
 ^SS Treatment^ - the variability resulting from the independent variable; 
                  i.e., the levels or categories of response
 ^SS Within^    - the variablity that cannot be accounted for by the 
                  independent variable
     a.   ^SS Subjects^ - the variability resulting from individual differences
&gt; .
     b.   ^SS Error^    - the variability resulting from random factors
<p>
Since each individual provides a value for each level or category of the in-
dependent variable, it is possible to measure the individual difference var-
iability. This is not possible in randomized designs. However, a warning 
must be given regarding the use of the test. In many instances when 
individuals arebeing measured over time there may be a carry-over effect from e
&gt; arly measure-
ments to later ones. This will bias the experiment.  Moreover, when there 
are more than two measurements, the model has the assumption of homogeneity 
of covariance. This assumption is violated, for example, when one pair of 
levels are fairly close in time whereas another pair are more distant. 
Violations of this sort affect Type I error rate. This problem is ameliorated b
&gt; y using the
Huynh-Feldt correction or by transforming the repetitions of dependent var-
iables into separate dependant variables and analyzing the model by 
profile analysis or MANOVA.

If a significant difference between levels of the independent variable 
has been determined, Tukey HSD tests may be calculated to ascertain which 
level(s)are significantly different. The formula is:
<p>
                ^HSD = q * sqrt((MS error)/N)^
<p>
where the appropriate ^q^ value is found on a Studentized Range Table.

Output of a ^ranova^ run with one missing value appears as:
