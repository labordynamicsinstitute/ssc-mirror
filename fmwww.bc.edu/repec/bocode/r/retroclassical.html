<b><u> Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>retroclassical</b> estimates a bivariate probit model with coefficients re-scaled t
&gt; o 
facilitate cross-equation testing for coefficient equality.  This model sets th
&gt; e 
cross-equation error covariance equal to zero.  It is termed retroclassical for
&gt;  it is 
midway between a variant of the neoclassical education transitions framework pr
&gt; oposed 
in Lucas, Fucella, and Berends (2011) and the classical education transitions 
approach.  Note that the first transition appears in the second equation in the
&gt;  
output.  Yet, in specifying the model the temporally earlier transition is alwa
&gt; ys 
regarded as the first transition.  The estimates are the re-scaled coefficients
&gt;  and 
the appropriate standard errors.  Any subsequent statistical tests will use thi
&gt; s 
second set of results.  A related command, neoclassical, estimates a 
neoclassical education transitions model while estimating a possibly non-zero 
cross-equation error variance.  neoclassical provides one part of one way to 
implement the neoclassical education transitions framework, calibrating the 
coefficients across transitions, while accounting for selection.
<p>
    <b>Y1</b> is the outcome variable for the first transition--this is the
        selection equation for the second transition
<p>
    <b>TC1</b> contains the list of time constant variables; these should be common
        across the first and second equations.  The set of variables should
        be in quotes
<p>
    <b>TV1Names</b> contains the names of the variables that have specific values
        for the first transition (and possibly different values for the
        second transition).  The set of variables should be in quotes
<p>
    <b>Exclusions</b> are those variables in the selection equation that are not in
        the equation for the second transition.  An explicit category is made
        for these variables to reinforce the necessity of having such
        variables to identify the selection process.  The set of variables
        should be in quotations, even if it is only 1 variable
<p>
    <b>Y1Independent</b> is the total number of independent variables in the first
        equation
<p>
    <b>Y2</b> is the outcome variable for the second transition--this is the last of
        the two transitions
<p>
    <b>TC1</b> contains the list of variables that are common across the first and
        second equations.  The set of variables should be in quotes and
        should have the exact same order as when the variables appeared
        earlier in the command
<p>
    <b>TV2Names</b> contains the variables that have specific values for the second
        transition (and possibly different values for the first transition).
        These variables should be in quotes
<p>
    <b>Y2Independent</b> is the total number of independent variables in the second
        transition equation
<p>
    <b>deff</b> MUST be supplied.  It is the value of the design effect.  If no
        design effect is needed, input 1.0.
<p>
    <b>cluster</b> is a variable you may use to obtain Huber-White standard errors
