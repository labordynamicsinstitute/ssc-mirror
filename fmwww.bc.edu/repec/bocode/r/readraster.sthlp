{bf:readraster} {hline 2} A package for reading and processing geospatial raster data in Stata


{marker syntax}{...}
{title:Syntax}

{p 8 17 2}
This package provides multiple commands for different geospatial data operations


{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:readraster} is an advanced Stata package designed for importing, processing, and analyzing geospatial raster data directly within Stata. 
The package supports multiple raster formats including GeoTIFF files and NetCDF files, making it invaluable for researchers working with 
satellite imagery, climate data, digital elevation models, nighttime lights, and other gridded spatial datasets.

{pstd}
The package bridges the gap between Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and statistical analysis by enabling users to:
import raster data with coordinate information, perform zonal statistics calculations, convert between coordinate reference systems,
match geographic datasets, and process multi-dimensional climate/environmental data.

{pstd}
{cmd:readraster} leverages Java libraries (GeoTools and NetCDF) to provide robust geospatial data processing capabilities,
automatically handling coordinate system transformations and spatial operations.

{title:Setup Java dependencies}

{dlgtab:Java JDK Configuration}

{pstd}
{browse "Java JDK configuration requirements:"}
{p_end}

{phang2}• {bf:Stata 17}: Requires manual Java JDK 17+ installation and configuration{p_end}
{phang2}• {bf:Stata 18+}: Uses built-in Java runtime (no additional configuration needed){p_end}

{dlgtab:For Stata 17 Users: Configure Java JDK 17+}

{pstd}
If you are using Stata 17, you need to download and install Java JDK 17 or later, then configure it in Stata.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:Step 1: Download and Install Java JDK 17+}

{pstd}
Download and install Java JDK 17 or later from the official Oracle website or OpenJDK distributions:
{p_end}

{phang2}• Oracle JDK: {browse "https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/"}{p_end}
{phang2}• OpenJDK: {browse "https://openjdk.org/"}{p_end}

{dlgtab:Step 2: Configure Java in Stata 17}

{pstd}
After installing Java JDK, configure the Java home directory in Stata by running:
{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. java set home "path_to_java_home_dir"}{p_end}

{pstd}
Replace {it:path_to_java_home_dir} with the actual path to your Java JDK installation directory (e.g., {cmd:"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17"} on Windows or {cmd:"/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64"} on Linux).
{p_end}

{pstd}
You can verify the Java configuration by running:
{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. java query}{p_end}

{dlgtab:For Stata 18+ Users}

{pstd}
Stata 18 and later versions include a compatible Java runtime environment. No additional Java JDK installation or configuration is required.
{p_end}

{dlgtab:GeoTools Library Setup}

{pstd}
Before using the commands {cmd:gtiffdisp}, {cmd:gtiffread}, {cmd:gtiffwrite}, {cmd:gzonalstats}, and {cmd:crsconvert}, you first need to download the GeoTools Version 32.0 Java library.
Once downloaded, place this library in Stata's adopath—or add the library's file path to Stata's adopath.
{p_end}

{pstd}
For a simplified setup, we provide a dedicated command: {cmd:geotools_init}.
To configure the environment automatically, simply run the following line in Stata:
{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. geotools_init, download plus(geotools)}{p_end}

{pstd}
Note that this process may take dozens of minutes—Stata’s speed for copying large files from the internet is relatively slow.
{p_end}

{pstd}
As a faster alternative, we recommend manually downloading the GeoTools library from {browse "https://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/geotools/GeoTools%2032%20Releases/32.0/geotools-32.0-bin.zip"} and unzipping the downloaded file. After doing so, initialize the environment by running:
{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. geotools_init} {it:path_to_geotools-32.0/lib}{cmd:, plus(geotools)}{p_end}

{pstd}
Note that you should replace {it:path_to_geotools-32.0/lib} with the actual file path to your unzipped GeoTools 32.0 lib folder.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Before using the commands {cmd:ncdisp} and {cmd:ncread}, you first need to download the NetCDF Version 5.9.1 Java library.
{p_end}

{pstd}
For a simplified setup, we provide a dedicated command: {cmd:netcdf_init}.
To configure the environment automatically, simply run the following line in Stata:
{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. netcdf_init, download plus(netcdf)}{p_end}

{pstd}
* The configuration described above is only required the first time you use the package.
