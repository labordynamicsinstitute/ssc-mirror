   ^method^ is a keyword for the allocation method. Different methods are
   available (see below).
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^v2seats^ allocates seats to parties using different allocation methods.
^varname^ is the variable containing voting data either at the aggregate or the
individual level. If ^varname^ contains frequencies of vote at the aggregate
level, ^party(^varname^)^ is required to identify party labels. This option sho
&gt; uld
NOT be used when analyzing individual voting data. You can choose between
allocating seats by district using ^district(^varlist^)^ ^size(^varname^)^ or
allocating seats for the whole dataset (in case there is no district
division) using only ^seats(^#^)^. You can also set a constant district size by
using ^district(^varname^)^ ^seats(^#^)^. Both ^if^ and ^in^ are allowed, altho
&gt; ugh ^by^ is
not supported.
<p>
Options
-----------
<p>
^party(^varname^)^ identifies the variable containing party labels. It should
  be used only when response variable is a frequency variable containing number
  of votes at the aggregate level.
<p>
^skip(^numlist^)^ tells the program to omit the votes for which party code is e
&gt; qual
  to any of the numbers in &lt;numlist&gt;, only for allocation purposes. These votes
  are supposed to be valid, but they are not votes for any particular party
  (for instance, blank votes). These votes will be taken into account to
  compute electoral thresholds.
<p>
^formula(^method^)^ | ^maj(^exp^)^ | ^lrm(^exp^)^ | ^seqv(^matname^)^ | ^hav(^e
&gt; xp^)^
  [^first(^numlist^)^] have to be used to set the allocation method. You can
  either use any of the pre-built allocation methods using ^formula(^method^)^,
&gt;  or
  define your own customized formula using ^maj(^exp^)^, ^lrm(^exp^)^, ^seqv(^m
&gt; atname^)^
  and ^hav(^exp^)^ [^first(^numlist^)^] options. However, only one allocation m
&gt; ethod
  at a time is allowed. When using ^formula(^method^)^ the following ^methods^ 
&gt; are
  available:
<p>
  ^Majority methods:^
    ^major^ uses majority rule (half of the vote is needed to get elected)
    ^plural^ uses plurality method or FPTP (the first candidate get elected)
    ^oplural^ uses ordered plurality method (the first n candidates get elected
&gt; )
<p>
  ^Largest remainder methods (quotas):^
    ^hare^ uses Hare quota or Niemeyer method (quota is v/s)
    ^hagb^ uses Hagenbach-Bischoff quota (quota is v/(s+1))
    ^droop^ uses Droop quota (quota is int((v/(s+1))+1)
    ^imp^ uses Imperiali quota (quota is v/(s+2))
    ^rimp^ uses reinforced Imperiali quota (quota is v/(s+3))
<p>
  ^Highest average methods (divisors):^
    ^dhondt^ uses D'Hondt method (divisors are: 1,2,3,4,...)
    ^stlague^ uses St. Laguë method (divisors are: 1,3,5,7,...)
    ^stlm^ uses modified St. Lagüe method (divisors are: 1.4,3,5,7,...)
    ^stlh^ uses Hungarian St. Lagüe method (divisors are: 1.5,3,5,7,...)
    ^danish^ uses Danish method (divisors are: 1,4,7,10,...)
    ^dimp^ uses Imperiali divisors method (divisors are: 1,1.5,2,2.5,...)
<p>
  ^Other methods (highest average):^
    ^hunt^ uses Huntington method (divisors are: sqrt(n*(n-1)), n = 1,2,3,4,...
&gt; )
    ^adams^ uses Adams method (divisors are: 0,1,2,3,...)
<p>
  ^Mixed methods (two-stages):^
    ^hare_h^ uses highest average remainder after Hare quota
    ^hagb_h^ uses highest average remainder after Hagenbach-Bischoff quota
    ^droop_h^ uses highest average remainder after Droop quota
    ^imp_h^ uses highest average remainder after Imperiali quota
    ^rimp_h^ uses highest average remainder after reinforced Imperiali quota
<p>
  ^all^ computes allocations using majority, largest reaminder and highest
    average methods (mixed and other methods are not reported).
    ^save(^filename^)^ is required to store results in &lt;filename&gt;. You can not
    combine ^formula(^all^)^ with ^preserve()^, ^collapse()^ or ^simulate(^#^)^
&gt; . It mutes
    ^rest^, ^waste^ and ^details^.
<p>
  ^Customized methods:^
    ^maj(^exp^)^ defines a majority formula using ^v^, where ^v^ is the total n
&gt; umber
    of votes. For example, ^maj(^v/2^)^ is equivalent to use ^formula(^major^)^
&gt; ,
    while ^maj(^2*v/3^)^ is equivalent to set the majority rule at 2/3.
<p>
    ^lrm(^exp^)^ defines a largest remainder formula using ^v^ and ^s^, where ^
&gt; v^ is the
    total number of votes and ^s^ is the number of seats. For example,
    ^lr(^v/(s+1)^)^ is equivalent to use ^formula(^hagb^)^.
<p>
    ^hav(^exp^)^ [^first(^numlist^)^] defines a highest average formula using ^
&gt; n^, where
    ^n^ is the nth divisor. [^first(^numlist^)^] is optional and sets up a cust
&gt; omized
    sequence for the first n divisors in &lt;numlist&gt;, which overrides the first n
    divisors defined by ^hav(^exp^)^, although only the first one needs to be
    changed for most methods. For example, ^ha(^2*n-1^)^ is equivalente to use
    ^formula(^stlague^)^, while ^ha(^2*n-1^)^ ^first(^1.4^)^ is equivalent to u
&gt; se
    ^formula(^stlm^)^.
<p>
    ^seqv(^matname^)^ allows to use a customized vector of divisors for a
    particular highest average method. To do that, user must define a column
    vector containing the full sequence of divisors. If the vector contains
    not enough divisors an error message will be issued. This option is not
    compatible with ^hav(^exp^)^ or any other allocation method.
<p>
^district(^varlist^)^ identifies districts. It is required when there are more
  than one district and if you use ^size(^varname^)^. If you use this option
  either ^size(^varname^)^ or ^seats(^#^)^ are required. If you do not use it
  the program will create a new variable automatically. Typically, &lt;varlist&gt;
  will contain only one variable identifying districts, but you can use up to
  five variables to nest districts within higher levels of aggregation (for
  instance, regions). I you are using ^save(^filename^)^, the new variables
  in &lt;filename&gt; will be named as distl1, distl2, ... from the highest level
  of aggregation to the lowest. For the sake of clarity, it is recommended to
  introduce the variables in &lt;varlist&gt; according to this aggregation ordering,
  since variables in &lt;filename&gt; will appear in the same order.
<p>
^size(^varname^)^ identifies district size. It is not compatible with ^seats()^
&gt; . It
  must take constant values within districts. In case of different values
  within districts, minimum values are taken.
<p>
^seats(^#^)^ informs how many seats have to be allocated. This option can be us
&gt; ed
  when there is only one district or there are multiple districts of the same
  size. ^seats(^#^)^ is incompatible with ^size()^.
<p>
^dthres(^numlist^)^ and ^athres(^numlist^)^ set district and aggregate threshol
&gt; ds
  respectively. You must type thresholds as percentages without % symbol. In
  order to simulate the effect of different thresholds you can set more than
  one value for any of the thresholds. In that case, ^save(^filename^)^ is requ
&gt; ired
  to store results in &lt;filename&gt;. You cannot combine multiple thresholds with
  ^simulate()^, ^preserve()^ or ^collapse()^.
<p>
^rest^ tells the program to store not allocated seats at district level in a ne
&gt; w
  variable called rest. ^save(^filename^)^ is required to store the results in
  &lt;filename&gt;. This option is useful when planning to allocate the remainder
  seats using a different allocation method or aggregation level. It is only
  allowed in combination with majority and largest remainder methods, given
  that highest average methods allocate all the seats at once. When used in
  combination with a largest remainder method, remainder are not used to
  allocate extra seats at the second stage. This option has no effect combined
  with ^formula(^all^)^, multiple thresholds and ^simulate()^.
<p>
^waste^ tells the program to store wasted votes in a new variable called
  waste in &lt;filename&gt;. Therefore, ^save(^filename^)^ is required to store
  results in &lt;filename&gt;. Wasted votes are computed at district level for each
  party. However, wasted votes are computed in different ways depending on the
  method in use.  For majority and highest average methods, only parties
  winning no seats in one or more districts get wasted votes. If one party
  wins no seats in one particular district, votes in this district are called
  wasted votes for this party. For largest remainder methods, wasted votes are
  computed as the number of votes exceeding the product of the quota times the
  number of seats the party has won in one particular district. Saving wasted
  votes is useful in combination with ^rest^ for further allocation of not
  allocated seats. This option has no effect combined with ^formula(^all^)^,
  multiple thresholds or ^simulate()^.
<p>
^preserve(^varlist^)^ allows to store in &lt;filename&gt; variables containing info
  at different levels of nesting. The lowest level is parties at district
  level. The highest level is the overall dataset. You can use this option to
  store information about parties at district level, information about
  districts, about the overall dataset or even about some intermediate levels
  of clustering. For instance, you can store variables containing attributes
  of a higher level of aggregation (such as regions, clusters or länders) for
  use in further analysis or allocations. The only requisite is that all the
  the variables must be constant within parties within districts. If there are
  different values for the same party in the same district, average values are
  taken. Be sure to check your data before using this option, since that could
  be the cause of wrong aggregation, which would cause errors in further
  analysis. Also consider that, if variables in &lt;varlist&gt; are not constant
  within parties at district level you can use ^stat()^ option to define a resu
&gt; me
  function. Up to ten variables are allowed. Repeated variables will be
  dropped. ^save(^filename^)^ is required to store variables in &lt;filename&gt;. For
  each variable in &lt;varlist&gt; one variable will be created. Variables are named
  using infix _, as _&lt;original_varname&gt;. However, value labels remain
  unchanged. You cannot combine this option with ^formula(^all^)^, multiple
  thresholds or ^simulate()^. It may be useful to combine with ^collapse()^ to
  aggregate results at some level of clustering.
<p>
^stat(^min | max | mean | median | sum^)^ is intended to be used only in
  combination with ^preserve(^varlist^)^, when you want to resume information
  for variables in &lt;varlist&gt; for each party at district level. Then, you
  can only use ^stat()^ with ^preserve()^. Otherwise, an error message will be
  issued. Valid options for ^stat^ are ^min^, ^max^, ^mean^, ^median^ and ^sum^
&gt; . ^mean^ is
  set by default if ^perserve()^ is used but ^stat()^ is missing. Only one
  statistic for &lt;varlist&gt; is allowed at a time. Note however, that ^stat()^ is
  not required if you are using ^preserve(^varlist^)^, and variables in &lt;varlis
&gt; t&gt;
  have constant values within parties at district level.
<p>
^collapse(^varlist^)^ tells the program to store results in &lt;filename&gt; by party
&gt;  and
  &lt;varlist&gt;. Variables in &lt;varlist&gt; must be in ^district(^varlist^)^. Otherwise
&gt; , an
  error message will be issued. You can collapse at any level of aggregation
  defined by ^district(^varlist^)^. For instance, if you specify the name of so
&gt; me
  intermediate level of aggregation (such as region) in ^district(^varlist^)^, 
&gt; you
  can store votes, seats (waste and rest if they are present) at this level. It
  also mutes ^details^. Be aware that aggregation level is determined by all th
&gt; e
  variables in ^collapse(^varlist^)^. For instance, if you want to collapse
  at an intermediate aggregation level you must include in &lt;varlist&gt; all the
  variables at higher levels. This is an advanced option to produce more
  personalized output in &lt;filename&gt; using Stata' command ^collapse^. It can
  produce some bizarre results if not used with caution. It is only recommended
  to use it if you are well aware of how ^collapse^ works in Stata.
  ^save(^filename^)^ is required. You cannot combine this option with
  ^formula(^all^)^, multiple thresholds or ^simulate()^.
<p>
^simulate(^#^)^ allows to simulate different results from variations in the
  number of votes. This option generates 100 samples of valid votes for each
  party using ^invnormal(uniform())^. This produces a random number of votes
  for each party drawn from a normal distribution with mean its real number
  of votes and standard deviation computed as a percentage of the mean, where
  this percentage is equal to #. Then you can control the scope of variation
  setting # between 0 and 100. For each simulation the program computes seats
  by party according to ^formula(^method^)^ and any other option. At the end of
&gt;  
  100 rounds the program computes the minimum, maximum and average number of
  seats, which are stored in min, max and avg in &lt;filename&gt;. Therefore,
  ^save(^filename^)^ is required to store results in &lt;filename&gt;. Also notice th
&gt; at
  you cannot combine simulate with ^formula(^all^)^, multiple thresholds,
  ^preserve()^ or ^collapse()^. It mutes ^rest^, ^waste^ and ^details^.
<p>
^details^ causes the program to report votes and seats when using
  ^formula(^plural^)^; votes, seats and quotas when using a largest remainder
  formula; and votes, seats and divisors when using a highest average formula.
  This option has no effect with ^formula(^all^)^, multiple thresholds,
  ^collapse()^ and ^simulate()^. If you are using ^nooutput^ option, that will
  cause ^details^ to report nothing.
<p>
^nooutput^ tells the program to produce no output. By default it is not
  activated, except with ^formula(^all^)^, multiple thresholds and
  ^simulate()^. It mutes ^details^ option.
<p>
^save(^filename^)^ allows to store results in &lt;filename&gt;. It is required with
  ^formula(^all^)^, multiple thresholds, ^rest^, ^waste^, ^preserve()^, ^collap
&gt; se()^,
  and ^simulate()^.
