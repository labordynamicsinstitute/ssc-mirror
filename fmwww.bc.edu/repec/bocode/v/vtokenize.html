<b>Split All Observations of a Variable into Tokens</b>
<p>
        <b>vtokenize</b> <i>varname</i> [<b>if</b> <i>exp</i>] [<b>in</b> <i>range</i>] [<b>,</b> <b>stub</b> <b><u>p</u></b><b>arse</b> <b>nospace</b>
              <b><u>nodelim</u></b><b>eters</b>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
Splits the <i>varname</i> into its component tokens, generating as many new variables
as needed.  (The original variable is left untouched.) Used for working with
truly nasty text files.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>stub</b> specifies the start of the names of the variables which will be generated.
    If omitted, the stub will simply be the name of the variable being split.
    The resulting variables will have suffixes _1, _2, ... or _01, _02, ... or
    _001, _002, ... depending on the number of variables generated.
<p>
<b>parse(delimiters)</b> gives the list of delimiters which are used to separate
    tokens.  If omitted, the only delimiter is whitespace (one or more spaces).
    There is no need to specify space a delimiter, though explicitly specifying
    it will not cause problems.
<p>
<b>nospace</b> is used to <b>prevent</b> spaces from being used as delimiters.
<p>
<b>nodelimiters</b> is used to <b>prevent</b> delimiters from being stored as tokens.  Note
    that just as with gettoken, spaces are never kept as tokens.
<p>
<b><u>Example(s)</u></b>
<p>
        . vtokenize foo
            Splits <i>foo</i> into words by breaking on space(s), storing the first
            word for each observation in <i>foo_1</i>, the second word in <i>foo_2</i>, etc.
            <i>foo</i> itself is not altered.
<p>
        . vtokenize foo, stub(bar)
            Splits <i>foo</i> into words by breaking on space(s), storing the first
            word for each observation in <i>bar_1</i>, the second word in <i>bar_2</i>, etc.
<p>
        . vtokenize foo, stub(bar) parse(":") nospace
            Splits <i>foo</i> into words by breaking on colons (:), storing the first
            token for each observation in <i>bar_1</i>, the second token in <i>bar_2</i>,
            etc.  The colons themselves <b>are</b> treated as tokens.
<p>
        . vtokenize foo, stub(bar) parse(":") nospace nodelimiters
            Splits <i>foo</i> into words by breaking on colons (:), storing the first
            token for each observation in <i>bar_1</i>, the second token in <i>bar_2</i>,
            etc.  The colons themselves are <b>not</b> treated as tokens.
<p>
        . vtokenize foo, stub(bar) parse(":")
            Splits <i>foo</i> into words by breaking on colons (:) and spaces, storing
            the first token for each observation in <i>bar_1</i>, the second token in
            <i>bar_2</i>, etc.  The colons themselves are treated as tokens, but the
            spaces are not.
<p>
<b><u>Notes</u></b>
<p>
<b>vtokenize</b> checks only to see if the variable <i>stub_*1</i> exists when doing error
checking.  Thus, it will die ungracefully if, say <i>stub_3</i> exists, but it needs
to generate its own <i>stub_3</i>
