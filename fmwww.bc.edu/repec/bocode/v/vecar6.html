^vecar6^ is for use with time-series data.  You must ^tsset^ your data before
using ^vecar6^; see help @tsset@.
<p>
^vecar6^ shares the features of all estimation commands; see help @est@.
<p>
<p>
The syntax of @predict@ following ^vecar6^ is
<p>
    ^predict^ [type] newvarname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] ^,^ [ ^eq^uation^(^eqno
&gt; ^)^
                         { ^xb^ | ^stdp^ | ^r^esiduals | ^d^ifferences | ^stdd^
&gt; p }
<p>
These statistics are available both in and out of sample; type ^predict^ ...
^if e(sample)^ ... if wanted only for the estimation sample.
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^vecar6^ estimates vector autoregression (VAR) models. Each of the variables in
depvarlist is regressed on ^maxlag(^#^)^ lags of depvarlist, a constant (unless
suppressed) and the exogenous variables provided in varlist (if any). varlist
may contain time-series operators.
<p>
A set of "block F" tests evaluates the joint significance of each variable's
lagged values in each equation.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^maxlag(^#^)^ must be specified, and must be at least 1.
<p>
^noconstant^ omits the constant term from estimation.
<p>
^exog(^varlist^)^ specifies the exogenous variables to be included in each
    equation.
<p>
^cov^ displays the covariance matrix of the residuals between equations. The
    divisor of the covariance terms is T, the number of sample observations,
    unless the dfk option is invoked. A comparison of this model with the
    zero-lag model (as a likelihood ratio test) is computed. Three criteria
    often employed for lag length selection are produced: the AIC (Akaike
    Information Criterion), BIC (Bayes or Schwarz Information Criterion) and
    the HQ (Hannan-Quinn) criterion. The cov option also causes three tests on
    the residuals to be performed: the multivariate portmanteau test of Ljung
    and Box, implemented in @wntstmvq@ (STB-60), the test for independence of
    the errors of Breusch and Pagan, implemented in @mvreg@, and the Doornik-
    Hansen omnibus test for multivariate normality, implemented in @omninorm@.
<p>
    These tests make use of Stata's matrix language; it may be necessary to use
    ^set matsize^ to increase the default matrix size before reading in the dat
&gt; a.
<p>
^dfk^ specifies the use of an alternate divisor in computing the covariance
    matrix for the equation errors.  As an asymptotically justified estimator,
    ^vecar6^ by default uses the number of sample observations (T) as a
    divisor.  When the dfk option is set, a small-sample adjustment is made and
    the divisor is taken to be sqrt(T - k).
<p>
^noheader^ suppresses display of the table reporting F statistics, R-squared,
    and root mean square error above the coefficient table.
<p>
^table^ displays the full coefficient table.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence interva
&gt; ls;
    see help @level@.
<p>
^saving(^name^)^ specifies that the log determinant of the residual covariance
    matrix associated with this model is to be saved as ^name^.
<p>
^using(^name^)^ specifies the name of the model against which this model is to 
&gt; be
    tested. The saved model should have a greater lag length, so that the
    likelihood ratio test compares the more general saved model with the
    restricted model currently estimated.
<p>
^uncorr^ specifies that the likelihood ratio tests for lag length implemented b
&gt; y
    ^saving^ and ^using^, as well as the test against the zero-order model
    implemented by ^cov^, are to be conducted without the adjustment for degree
&gt; s
    of freedom advocated by Sims (1980). Without this option, the difference
    between log determinants of the respective covariance matrices is scaled by
    (T-c), where T is the number of observations and c is the number of
    regressors in each of the unrestricted model's equations. With the ^uncorr^
    option, the multiplier is merely T.
<p>
<p>
Options for @predict@
-------------------
<p>
^equation(^eqno^)^ specifies to which equation you are referring.
<p>
    ^equation()^ is filled in with one ^eqno^ for options ^xb^, ^stdp^, ^residu
&gt; als^.
    ^equation(#1)^ would mean the calculation is to be made for the first
    equation, ^equation(#2)^ would mean the second, and so on.  Alternatively,
    you could refer to the equations by their names.  ^equation(income)^ would
    refer to the equation named income and ^equation(hours)^ to the equation
    named hours.
<p>
    If you do not specify ^equation()^, results are as if you specified
    ^equation(#1)^.
<p>
    ^stddp^ and ^difference^ refer to between-equation concepts.  To use these
    options, you must specify ^equation(#1,#2)^ or ^equation(income,hours)^. Wh
&gt; en
    two equations must be specified, ^equation()^ is not optional.
<p>
^xb^ the default, calculates the linear prediction from the estimated model.
<p>
^stdp^ calculates the standard error of the linear prediction.
<p>
^residuals^ calculates the residuals.
<p>
^difference^ calculates the difference between the linear predictions of two
    equations in the system.
<p>
^stddp^ calculates the standard error of the difference in linear predictions
    between two equations.
<p>
