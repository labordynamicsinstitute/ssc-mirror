Vertical parallel line plot
---------------------------
<p>
        ^vplplot^ yvar1 yvar2 [xvar] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
        [^,^ { ^d^iff | ^r^atio } ^b^ase^(^#^)^ 
        { ^m^ean | ^g^mean | ^so^rt^(^sortvarlist^)^ }

<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^vplplot^ plots paired data for yvar1 and yvar2 using parallel vertical
lines to show the differences between values. 
<p>
By default, yvar1 and yvar2 are plotted on the vertical axis.  Normally 
yvar1 and yvar2 will have the same units. 
 
If xvar is specified it is used for the horizontal axis: otherwise by 
default the order of the observations is used for the horizontal axis.
<p>
Other kinds of plots may be obtained through particular options. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^diff^ specifies that the y axis should show the difference between 
    yvar1 and yvar2, i.e. yvar1 - yvar2. 
<p>
^ratio^ specifies that the y axis should show the ratio of yvar1 and 
    yvar2, i.e. yvar1 / yvar2. 
<p>
^base(^#^)^ specifies a baseline for comparison if either ^diff^ or 
    ^ratio^ is specified. With ^diff^, ^base^ has default 0. With 
    ^ratio^, ^base^ has default 1. 
<p>
^mean^ specifies that the x axis should show the mean of yvar1 and yvar2. 
    This option may not be combined with specification of xvar, 
    or with ^gmean^ or ^sort( )^.
    
^gmean^ specifies that the x axis should show the geometric mean of yvar1 
    and yvar2. This option may not be combined with specification of xvar, 
    or with ^mean^ or ^sort( )^. It requires that data be positive for both 
    yvar1 and yvar2.
<p>
^sort(^sortvarlist^)^ specifies that the order of the data is determined by 
    sortvarlist. The x axis then shows order of observations on 
    sortvarlist. This option invokes @gsort@, so that the order of sorting 
    may be indicated by + or - signs. This option may not be combined 
    with specification of xvar, or with ^mean^ or ^gmean^. 
<p>
graph_options refers to options of ^graph, twoway^.
<p>
    The defaults include ^symbol(Opii) connect(..||) pen(2344) gap(6)^
<p>
    Users wishing to vary graph_options should note that four choices 
    should be specified for ^symbol^, ^connect^ and ^pen^. 
<p>
Remarks
------- 
<p>
The default graph is 
<p>
    ^graph^ y1var y2var y1var y2var xvar ^, sy(Opii) c(..||)^  
<p>
where xvar is observation number, a specified x variable, 
or the mean of y1 and y2, or the geometric mean of y1 and y2.
<p>
With ^diff^ the default graph is 
<p>
    ^graph^ (y1var - y2var) base (y1var - y2var) base xvar 
    ^, sy(Opii) c(..||)^  
<p>
With ^ratio^ the default graph is    
<p>
    ^graph^ (y1var / y2var) base (y1var / y2var) base xvar
    ^, sy(Opii) c(..||)^  
<p>
Note that 
<p>
    ^vplplot^ y1 y2 ^, ratio gmean xlog ylog^          
<p>
is equivalent to 
<p>
    ^vplplot^ log(y1) log(y2) ^, diff mean^         
<p>
except for the axis labelling.
