<b><u>vcf</u></b>
<p>
     <b>vcf</b> -- Used to import VCF (Variant Caller Format)
            Files into Stata and format genotype data.
<p>
     This program does 2 challenging things:
<p>
     (1) Splits the INFO column (delimited by ;) into
     seperate columns. It also pulls out variable
     descriptions and assigns them as variable labels.
<p>
     (2) Recodes genotypic data, showing the genotypes of
     each individual.
<p>
     <b>Important!</b> This is a new release, as such it is still
     undergoing development. Please report any
     issues/errors/comments/suggests (email above).
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
     <b>vcf using "path/to/file.vcf"</b>
<p>
<b><u>Limits</u></b>
<p>
     (1) While it is possible to read in very large files -
     this program cannot handle enormous VCF Files. I have
     successfully loaded in files that are a few gigabytes.
<p>
     (2) If your VCF Files has more than 9 alternative
     alleles, this program will incorrectly assign alleles
     beyond the 9th alternative allele.
