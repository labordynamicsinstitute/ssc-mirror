d 'POWER_ROC': module to compute power and sample-size analysis for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
d
d  The power roc package is helpful for planning studies that use
d receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the
d accuracy of diagnostic tests. An advantage of ROC curves for
d evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests is that it
d incorporates both sensitivity (the probability of a test
d detecting disease when the patient actually has the disease) and
d specificity (the probability that the test is negative when the
d patient is actually disease-free), into a single measure of
d accuracy. power roc is loosely based upon the code used in the
d SASÂ® macro ROCPOWER (Zepp 1995). power oneroc computes sample
d size or power for a one-sample receiver operating characteristic
d (ROC) analysis. Variance functions are computed using either the
d method described in Obuchowski, Lieber and Wians (2004) for
d continuous and ordinal data assuming a binormal distibution (the
d default), or the method described by Hanley and McNeil (1982) for
d continuous data which is based on the Mann-Whitney version of the
d rank-sum test. power tworoc computes sample size or power for a
d two-sample receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. 
d When there is no correlation corr(0) between the two alternative
d AUCs (auc1 and auc2), power tworoc computes sample size (power)
d for an independent two-sample test. When the correlation does not
d equal 0, power tworoc computes sample size (power) for a paired
d two-sample test. As with power oneroc, variance functions are
d computed using either the method described in Obuchowski, Lieber
d and Wians (2004) for continuous and ordinal data assuming a
d binormal distribution (the default), or the method described by
d Hanley and McNeil (1982) for only continuous data which is based
d on the Mann-Whitney version of the rank-sum test. Sample size can
d be computed given power, and power can be computed given sample
d size. Results can be displayed in a table (default) and on a
d graph ([PSS-2] power, graph).
