{title:Description}

{pstd}
The {cmd:pip} command has the same functionality as the {browse "https://pip.worldbank.org/":PIP website}. 
It allows Stata users to compute poverty and inequality indicators for over 160 countries 
in the World Bank's database of household surveys. PIP is a computational tool that allows 
users to conduct country-specific, cross-country, as well as global and regional poverty analyses. 
Users are able estimate rates  over time and at any poverty line specified. {cmd:pip} reports a 
wide range of measures for poverty (at any chosen poverty line) and inequality. See full list of indicators 
available in {cmd:pip} {help pip##list:below}.

{pstd}
The underlying welfare aggregate is the per capita household income or consumption
 expressed in 2017 PPP USD (with an option to select the 2011 PPPs). Poverty lines are expressed in daily amounts, as well as 
 the means and medians. For more information on the methodology,{browse "https://worldbank.github.io/PIP-Methodology/": click here}.
 
{pstd}
PIP is the result of a close collaboration between World Bank staff accross the Development Data Group, the Development Research Group, and the Poverty and Inequality Global Practice. 


{marker memory}{...}
{title:Memory use and frames}:

{pstd}
{cmd:pip} makes use of the `frames` feature--available since Stata 16--to store a lot of information in memory. This is partly the reason why the first call of pip in a new Stata session is slower compared to subsequent calls. When closing Stata, you may see a pop-up 
message reading {bf:"Frames in memory have changed"}. That is perfectly normal and should not cause any concern. 
However, make sure you save the frames that you created and wish to keep. You can do that by typing {stata frames dir}. 
Frames created by {cmd:pip} are prefixed by {it:_pip} and are marked by an {it:*}, meaning they have not been saved. If you do not wish to save any frames in use, just click "Exit without saving." You can also delete all PIP data in memory using the command {stata pip cleanup}.


{marker typesc}{...}
{title:Type of calculations}:

{pstd}
The pip API reports two types of results:

{phang}
{opt Survey-year}: Estimates refer to the survey period.

{phang}
{opt Reference-year}: Loads poverty measures for a reference year that is common across countries.
Regional and global aggregates are calculated only for reference-years. Survey-year estimates are extrapolated 
or interpolated to a common reference year. These extrapolations and interpolations require additional assumptions,
namely that (a) growth in household income or consumption can be approximated by growth in national accounts and
(b) all parts of the distribution grow at the same rate.{cmd: pip wb} returns the global and regional poverty aggregates
used by the World Bank. 

{pin}
{err:Important}: The option {it:fillgaps} reports the underlying country estimates for a reference-year.
These may coincide with the survey-year estimates if the country has a survey in the reference year. In other cases, 
these would be extrapolated from the nearest survey or interpolated between two surveys. 

{pin}
Poverty measures that are calculated for both survey-years and reference-years  include the headcount ratio, poverty gap,
and squared poverty gap. Inequality measures, including the Gini index, the mean log deviation and decile shares,
are calculated only in survey-years and are not reported for reference-years.

{marker param}{...}
{p 40 20 2}(Go up to {it:{help pip##sections:Sections Menu}}){p_end}
{title:Parameters description}

{phang}
{opt country(string)} {help pip_countries##countries:Countries and Economies Abbreviations}. 
If specified with {opt year(#)}, this option will return all the countries for which there is
actual survey data in the year specified.  When selecting multiple countries, use the corresponding
three-letter codes separated by spaces. The option {it:all} is a shorthand for calling all countries.

{phang}
{opt region(string)} {help pip_countries##regions:Regions Abbreviations}  If 
specified with {opt year(#)}, this option will return all the countries in the specified region(s)
that have a survey in that year. For example, {opt region(LAC)} will return all countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean that have a survey in the specific year. When selecting multiple regions,
use the corresponding three-letter codes separated by spaces. The  option {it:all} is a shorthand
for calling all regions, which is equivalent to  calling all countries.

{phang}
{opt coverage(string)} Selects the geographic coverage of the estimates. By default, all coverage
levels are loaded, but the user may select "national", "urban", or "rural".
Only one level of coverage can be selected per query.

{phang}
{opt year(#)} Four digit years are accepted. When selecting multiple years, use
spaces to separate them. The option {it:all} is a shorthand for calling all
years, while the {it:last} option will download the latest available year
for each country.

{phang}
{opt povline(#)} The poverty lines for which the poverty measures will be calculated.
When selecting multiple poverty lines, use less than 4 decimals and separate
each value with spaces. If left empty, the default poverty line of $2.15 is used.
By default, poverty lines are expressed in 2017 PPP USD per capita per day.
If option {opt ppp_ppp(2011)} is specified, the poverty lines are expressed in 2011 PPPs.

{phang}
{opt popshare(#)} The desired quantile. For example, specifying popshare(0.1) returns the first
decile as the value of the poverty line. In other words, the estimated poverty line will be the
nearest income or consumption level such that the incomes of 10% of the population fall below it.
This has no default, and cannot be combined with {opt povline}. The quantile (recorded in the variable
poverty_line) is expressed in 2017 PPP USD per capita per day (unless option {opt ppp_year(2011)} is specified,
in which case it is reported in 2011 PPPs).

{phang}
{opt fillgaps} Loads all country-level estimates that are used to create the  
global and regional aggregates in the reference years.

{p 8 8 2}{err:Note}: Countries without a survey in the reference-year have been 
extrapolated or interpolated using national accounts growth rates and assuming
distribution-neutrality (see Chapter 6
{browse "https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/20384/9781464803611.pdf":here}).
Therefore, changes at the country-level from one reference year to the next need 
to be interpreted carefully and may not be the result of a new household survey.{p_end}

{opt information} Presents a clickable version of the available surveys, countries 
and regions. Selecting countries from the menu loads the survey-year estimates.
Choosing regions loads the regional aggregates in the reference years. 

{p 8 8 2}{err:Note}: If option {it:clear} is added, data in memory is replaced 
with a pip guidance database. If option {it:clear} is {ul:not} included,
{cmd:pip} preserves data in memory  but displays a clickable interface of survey
availability in the results window.{p_end} 

{phang}
{opt wb} Download the World Bank's regional and global aggregates. It can be
combined with {it:year()} to filter the aggregated data.

{phang}
{opt tables} Provides access to the auxiliary tables. 
Default command {stata pip tables} a list of auxiliary tables using the 2017 PPPs.
Users can also specify PPP year as {stata  pip tables, ppp_year(2017)}.

{phang}
{opt cleanup} Deletes all PIP data from Stata's memory. 

{phang}
{opt test} By typing {stata pip test}, {cmd:pip} makes use of the global
"${pip_query}" to query your browser directly and test whether the data is
downloadable. 

{p 4 8 2}
{opt install} Install the stamble version of {cmd:pip} from SSC ({cmd:pip install ssc}) or
the development version from GitHub ({cmd:pip install gh}). the {it:install} subcommand 
is intended to keep your {help sysdir:search path} clean. Say that you install the 
dev version from GitHub in the regular way and then 
you install the stable from SSC. By doing that, you are creating 
two entries in the {it:stata.trk} file, making Stata believe that you have {cmd:pip} 
installed twice, which in fact you do. You can confirm this by typing the following, {p_end}
{cmd}
	github install worldbank/pip  {text:// development}
	ssc install pip, replace      {text:// stable}
	
	* {text:You can't uninstall pip directly}
	ado uninstall pip
	{err:criterion matches more than one package}
	
	* {text:This is because you have two versions of {cmd:pip} installed}
	ado dir pip
{result}
	[318] package pip from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worldbank/pip/master

	[319] package pip from http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/p
	'PIP': module to access poverty and inequality data from the World Bank's Poverty and 
	Inequality Platform (PIP)
{text}
{p 8 8 2}
By using the {it:install} subcommand, {cmd:pip} makes sure all the conflicting installations
are solved. You can install {cmd:pip} from SSC and from GitHub, one after the other, and you 
won't have conflicting installations. 
Be aware that if you have more than one version installed in your search path, 
{cmd:pip} is going to request you to confirm that you want to uninstall both versions by type 
{it:yes} in the conosole and hitting enter.
{p_end}

	{cmd:pip install ssc}
{err}
	There is more than one version of PIP installed in the same search path, PLUS.
	You need to uninstall pip in PLUS or change installation path with option path()
	Type yes in the console and hit enter to confirm you agree to uninstall pip. 
{text}
{p 4 8 2}
{opt uninstall} You can uninstall any version of {cmd:pip} in your search path by typing, 
{cmd:pip uninstall}. In this way, you can install {cmd:pip} from scratch from either SSC
of GitHub.
{p_end}

{p 4 8 2}
{opt update} This subcommand makes sure your {cmd:pip} version is up to date. By default, 
the first time that you use {cmd:pip} in a session, it will search for any new available versions 
available on the either SSC of GitHub, depending on where you installed it from (this is 
why the first time takes longer than the others). However, it could be the 
case that you're using an old version on purpose and now want to get the newer version 
without leaving your Stata session. Just type {cmd:pip update}.

{p 4 4 2}To calculate global poverty estimates, survey-year estimates are extrapolated
or interpolated to a common reference year. These extrapolations and interpolations require
additional assumptions, namely that (a) growth in household income or consumption can be
approximated by growth in national accounts and (b) all parts of the distribution grow at
the same rate. Given these assumptions, users are cautioned against using reference-year
estimates (available using the fillgaps option) for comparing a country's poverty trend over time.
For that purpose, users should rely on the survey-year estimates and are advised to take into
account breaks in survey comparability. For details on the methodology please visit the
{browse "https://worldbank.github.io/PIP-Methodology/":PIP Methodology Handbook} and the {browse "https://pip.worldbank.org/publication":Global Poverty Monitoring Technical Notes}.
{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}The term country, used interchangeably with economy, does not imply political independence
but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics.
