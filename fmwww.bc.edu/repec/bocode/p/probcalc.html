<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
  probcalc calculates the probability mass function for the discrete binomial
  and Poisson distributions and the probability density function for the
  continuous normal distribution.  Output is written to the display in a
  format useful for learning probability calculations.
<p>
  The algorithm can handle probability questions pertaining to, for example,
  "exactly 5 events," "at most 120 events," and "at least 7 events."
