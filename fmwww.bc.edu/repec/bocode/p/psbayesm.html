Pseudo-Bayes smoothing of cell estimates (matrix version)
---------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^psbayesm^ data_matrix [prior_matrix]
    [ ^, m^atrix^(^matname^) p^rob ^f^ormat^(^%fmt^)^
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^psbayes^ takes data_matrix, which should be a set of frequencies, and
shrinks or smooths it towards a set of frequencies implied by prior
probabilities. This will have the effect of replacing sampling
zeros by positive estimates whenever the priors are positive.
<p>
For a matrix of data frequencies n_ij, summing to n, and a matrix of
prior probabilities q_ij, the smoothed estimates are n * p_ij, where
<p>
                  n   n_ij      k
        p_ij =  ----- ---- +  ----- q_ij,
                n + k   n     n + k
<p>
and shrinkage is tuned by the constant
<p>
                2             2
               n  - sum ( n_ij )
        k = -----------------------.
                                  2
            sum (n_ij - n * q_ij )
<p>
These estimates minimise the total mean square error between
estimated and estimand probabilities. For more details, see the
References.
<p>
If prior_matrix is specified, it must sum to 1. If prior_matrix is not
specified, it is taken to be a matrix of equal probabilities.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
The data matrix may be entered directly into Stata or it may be produced
by a previous command, such as ^tabulate^.
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^matrix(^matname^)^ specifies that results are to be placed in matrix
    matname.
<p>
^prob^ indicates that probabilities rather than estimated frequencies
    are to be shown (and if desired kept).
<p>
^format(^%fmt^)^ controls the format with which matrix output is
    printed. Default ^format(%9.1f)^.
<p>
