{bf:Linear model} 

{pstd}
This model type calculates the following indices for the user's linear model: (1) the Impact Threshold for a Confounding Variable (ITCV), which indicates how strongly an omitted variable must be correlated with both the predictor of interest and the outcome to adjust the estimated effect to a user-specified p-value (e.g., 0.05); and (2) the Robustness of Inference to Replacement (RIR), which measures the proportion of data that must be replaced (with cases showing a specific null effect) to adjust the estimated effect to a given p-value (e.g., 0.5).

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:pkonfound} this command calculates (1) how much bias there must be in an estimate to nullify/sustain an inference. The bias necessary to nullify/sustain an inference is interpreted in terms of sample replacement; (2) the impact of an omitted variable necessary to nullify/sustain an inference for a regression coefficient. It also assesses how strong an omitted variable has to be correlated with the outcome and the predictor of interest to nullify/sustain the inference.
