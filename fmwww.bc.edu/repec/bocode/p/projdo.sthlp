{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:projdo} is just a convenience for dealing with {help cdl##project:project settings} do-files (ie, {cmd:PROJECT SETTINGS.do} and {cmd:PROJECT SETTINGS off.do}).
You could create, edit, or run them in the usual way, but this command saves some effort dealing with names and paths.

{pstd}{cmd:projdo run} (re)runs the relevant file for the {help cdl##project:current project directory}.

{pstd}{cmd:projdo edit} opens the relevant file for editing.
If there is no {help cdl##project:current project directory}, {cmd:projdo edit} will create {cmd:PROJECT SETTINGS.do} in the current working directory (which then becomes the {help cdl##project:current project directory}).
