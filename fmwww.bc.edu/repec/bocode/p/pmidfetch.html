<a name="description"></a><b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>pmidfetch</b> uses the efetch utilities provided by the NCBI (National Center
    for Biotechnology Information) to retrieve information for a given list
    of PMIDs (Pubmed Identifiers).
<p>
    You should use <b>pmidfetch</b> for data management/retrieval purposes
    primarily. It creates several variables with set names and fills them
    with data. It will <b>overwrite</b> pre-existing data in these variables
    (example: Gene_ID, Chr_ID, Alleles).
<p>
    Ideally, you'll use this plugin to annotate a dataset you have by running
    it on only the set of snps from the set and merging or by taking care
    with the names of the variables in your set.
<p>
    One thing you might try: <b>pmidfetch</b> downloads the MeSH terms (MeSH =
    Medical Subject Headings) and authors for a given publication.
<p>
    You can use the strmatch function to identify authors or to classify
    publications by subject.
<p>
    <b>pmidfetch</b> can handle duplicates.
<p>
<a name="usage"></a><b><u>Usage</u></b>
<p>
    Follow the command with the name of a variable specifying a list of SNPs.
    Your list can be numeric, ignoring the rs prefix, or a string with or
    without the rs prefix.<b>  pmidfetch</b> will work with both and download a
    large amount of data for each set.
<p>
    The option<b> bundle</b> can be used to adjust how many records Stata will
    attempt to download at once.<b> pmidfetch</b> works by downloading a set of
    records for your list of snps, parsing each set out, add the data to your
    dataset, and move onto the next set. This was necessary due to string
    length limitations within Stata.
