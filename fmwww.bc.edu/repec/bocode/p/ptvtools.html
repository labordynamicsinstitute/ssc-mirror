    ptvtools --    Various tools for PTV analysis
<p>
<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>ptvtools</b> package is a small collection of tools for the analysis of
    PTVs.  In electoral survey research, this acronym refers to Propensities
    To Vote, batteries of items concerning the self-reported probability that
    the respondent will <i>ever</i> vote for a specific party, and intended as
    indicators of what Downs (1957) referred to as "electoral utilities" (see
    van der Eijk and Franklin, Choosing Europe, University of Michigan Press
    1996; van der Eijk et al., Electoral Studies 2006; van der Eijk and
    Franklin, Elections and Voters, Palgrave Macmillan 2009).
<p>
    PTV analysis makes some specific demands both on the data and on the
    methods of analysis.
<p>
    Firstly, data <i>stacking</i> is usually involved, implying that - in Stata
    terminology - data are better analyzed when in <i>long</i> rather than in <i>wide</i>
    form (see reshape).  However, the tools facilitate reshaping of a dataset
    with multiple contexts, (eg. countries) each with possibly different
    numbers of items (eg. parties) in the battery(ies) to be stacked
    (different numbers of items having missing data for all cases in the
    context). After stacking, each respondent is represented by multiple rows
    in the data matrix, one for each of the items that was not entirely
    missing.
<p>
    Secondly, the dependent variable is usually not the propensity to vote
    for a particular party, but for a <i>generic</i> party (yielding comparability
    across contexts if these involve different party systems, as is common).
    This also affects <i>independent</i> variables, which have to be specially
    treated - reformulated it terms of distances (proximities) or in terms of
    some other type of affinity, for instance so-called <i>y-hats</i> - before they
    can be used in a stacked analysis. In this, ptv analysis resembles
    analysis of discrete choice models for which it serves as a substitute,
    dealing with directly-measured preferences (utilities) rather than
    deriving these from the analysis of choices made.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>ptvtools</b> package includes the following commands:
<p>
    <b>gendist</b>        (Context-wise) generation of distances for a battery of
                     spatial items, after optionally plugging missing data on
                     the spatial items
    <b>iimpute</b>        (Context-wise) incremental simple or multiple imputation
                     of a set of variables
    <b>genstacks</b>      (Context-wise) reshaping of a dataset for PTV analysis
    <b>genyhats</b>       (Context-wise) generation of <i>y-hat</i> affinity measures
                     linking indeps to ptvs
    <b>gendummies</b>     generation of a set of dummy variables, with specific
                     options
<p>
<p>
    These tools largely duplicate existing commands in Stata but operate on
    data with multiple contexts (eg. countries) each of which requires
    separate treatment. Moreover, all of the commands in <b>ptvtools</b> have
    additional features not readily duplicated with existing Stata commands
    even for data that relate to a single context. If the <b>contextvars</b> option
    is not specified, each of the individual tools treats the data as
    belonging to a single context.
<p>
    The commands take a variety of options, as documented in individual help
    files, some with quite cumbersome names. However, ALL options can be
    abbreviated to their first three characters and many can be omitted (as
    documented).
<p>
    The commands also save a variety of indicator variables (as documented).
    Most of these start with an underscore character and can be deleted by
    "drop _*" if you don't want them to clutter your dataset.  Three
    variables created by the command genstacks are needed by other tools and
    do not start with the underscore character. These are genstacks_stack,
    genstacks_item and genstacks_nstacks.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Workflow</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>genstacks</b> command always operates on an unstacked dataset, reshaping
    it into a stacked format.  Other commands may operate either before or
    after stacking. No means is provided for unstacking a previously stacked
    dataset.
<p>
    The commands, <b>gendist</b>, <b>iimpute</b> and <b>genyhats</b> by default assume the data
    are stacked and treat each stack as a separate context to be taken into
    account along with any higher-level contexts.  These commands can,
    however, be used on unstacked data or they can be forced to ignore the
    stacked structure of the data by specifying the <b>nostack</b> option. This
    option has no effect on <b>gendummies</b> or on a command that is being used on
    unstacked data (since unstacked data have only one stack per case). With
    stacked data the <b>nostack</b> option has the effect of making the command
    ignore the separate contexts represented by each stack. This might be
    considered desirable if prior analysis has established that there is no
    stack-specific heterogeneity relevant to the estimation model for which
    these operations are being conducted, or in order to impute a variable
    that is completely missing in one stack (for example a question that was
    not asked for a particular choice option).
<p>
    For logical reasons some restrictions apply to the order in which
    commands can be issued.  In particular:
 
        (1) <b>iimpute</b> (when used for its primary purpose of imputing missing
        values for a battery of items) requires that data are not stacked,
        since members of that battery (eg. PTVs) are used for the imputation
        of other members of the same battery;
<p>
        (2) <b>gendist</b> can be useful for removing missing data from items that
        can then be named in the <b>addvars</b> option to help <b>iimpute</b> missing data
        on other variables;
<p>
        (3) if <b>genyhats</b> is used before stacking, it will have to be used once
        for each of the individual depvars that will, after stacking, become
        a single (generic) depvar;
<p>
        (4) if <b>gendist</b> is employed after stacking, the items to which
        distances are computed have themselves to have been reshaped into
        long format by stacking them; and finally
<p>
        (5) after stacking and the generation of y-hat affinity variables,
        the number of indeps required for a final (set of) <b>iimpute</b> command(s)
        will generally be greatly reduced, making it easier to adhere to
        Stata's 30 variable limit on indeps used for imputation.
<p>
    Consequently, a typical workflow would involve <b>iimpute</b> to fill out the
    battery of PTVs by imputing any missing data, followed by <b>genstacks</b> to
    stack the data. This would probably be followed by <b>genyhats</b>, used to
    transform indeps (those that will not be transformed into distance
    measures) into y-hat affinity measures linking these indeps to the
    stacked depvar. The <b>gendist</b> command would then be used to plug missing
    values on item location variables and generate distances to be used in a
    final (set of) <b>iimpute</b> command(s) that will eliminate remaining missing
    data. This entire workflow sequence would need to be repeated as many
    times as datasets are required for multiple imputation.
<p>
    Considerable flexibility is available, however, to transform a dataset in
    any sequence thought appropriate, since any of the other commands can be
    employed either before or after <b>genstacks</b>.  Moreover, the researcher can
    use the <b>nostack</b> option to force the production of y-hats that "average
    out" contextual differences by regarding all stacks (and perhaps also all
    higher-level contexts) as a single context. This might be thought
    desirable after having established that there were no significant
    differences between these contexts in terms of the behavior of variables
    to be included in an estimation model.
