<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
 
<b>pescadf</b> runs the t-test for unit roots in heterogenous panels with
cross-section dependence, proposed by Pesaran (2003). Parallel to Im, Pesaran
and Shin (IPS, 2003) test, it is based on the mean of individual DF (or ADF)
t-statistics of each unit in the panel. Null hypothesis assumes that all series
are non-stationary.  To eliminate the cross dependence, the standard DF (or
ADF) regressions are augmented with the cross section averages of lagged levels
and first-differences of the individual series (CADF statistics).  Considered
is also a truncated version of the CADF statistics which has finite first and
second order moments.  It allows to avoid size distortions, especially in the
case of models with residual serial correlations and linear trends (Pesaran,
2003).
<p>
In the case where T is fixed, to ensure that the CADF statistics do not depend
on the nuisance parameters the effect of the initial cross-section mean must
also be eliminated, this can be achieved by applying the test to the deviations
of the variable from initial crosssection mean Pesaran (2003).  Lags of the
dependent variable may be introduced to control for serial correlation in the
errors.  The order of augmentation, can be estimated using model selection
criteria such as Akaike or Schwartz applied as usual to the underlying time
series specification.
<p>
The exact critical values of the t-bar statistic are given by Pesaran (2003).
The critical values and summary statistics of the individual t are also given
in the paper, so the Z[t-bar] statistic parallel to IPS (2003) Z[t-bar] (4.10)
is distributed standard normal under the null hypothesis of nonstationarity.
Moreover, Pesaran (2003) suggests that generalization of the test to unbalanced
panels can be made straightforwardly as IPS (2003) show. Hence in case of
unbalanced panels only standarized Z[t-bar] statistics can be computed.
<p>
 
Analogous to IPS (2003) test, Pesaran's CADF is consistent under the
alternative that only a fraction of the series are stationary.

<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>lags</b> must be specified, and may be uqual to any non-negative integer. Provided
    should be or single value which determines the lag length for all units in
    panel, or a list of lags matching the number of units in the panel.
<p>
<b>trend</b> includes a time trend in the estimated equation.
<p>
<b>nodemean</b> neglects eliminating initial cross-section mean from the variable
    tested. Applying the test to such deviations is default version because it
    is suggested by Pesaran (2003).
<p>
<b>trunoff</b> As CADF statistics has no finite first and second moments, Pesaran
    (2003) suggest replacing extreme values of the test statistics by K1 or K2
    such that Pr [-K1 &lt; ti(N, T) &lt; K2] is sufficiently large, namely in excess
    of 0.9999.  Pesaran (2003) simulates K1 and K2 for 3 types of model
    depending on the deterministic part (no deterministics; intercept,
    intercept and linear trend)
