prwe calculates the ^PRWE scores^ (Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation) from your re
&gt; cords
<p>
The PRWE is a 15-item questionnaire designed to measure wrist pain and disabili
&gt; ty in 
activites of daily living. 
It consists of two subscales: pain (5 items scored 0-10) and function (10 items
&gt;  scored 0-10). 
<p>
Two subscale scores are computed and a total score is computed by summing the t
&gt; wo subscales scores. 
<p>
The PRWE includes two subscale scores (pain and function) as well as a total sc
&gt; ore. 
<p>
<p>
Syntax: 
^prwe^ varlist [if] [in], generate(newvarname)  [subscales]
<p>
        ^varlist^ must contain the 15 numeric variables to calculate the PRWE t
&gt; otal score, these
        should appear in the same order as in the questionnaire (var1-var5 for 
&gt; pain and var6-var15 for function)
<p>
        ^gen(^varname^)^ is used to specify where the total score has to be sto
&gt; red
<p>
        ^subscales^ is specified if the subscales scores have to be stored
                
 
                  
Examples: 
<p>
^prwe^ PRWE1-PRWE15, gen(PRWE)  
^prwe^ Pain1-Pain5 Function1-Function10, gen(PRWE) sub
^prwe^ PRWE1-PRWE5, gen(PRWE) sub
<p>
Note:
The variables containing the information for the calculation have to be numeric
&gt; al and 
contain values between 1 and 10. 
<p>
<p>
Treatment of Missing Data:
A summary score calculated if a respondent answered at least 4 out of 5 questio
&gt; ns for the 
pain subscale and 8 of 10 questions for the function subscale.
