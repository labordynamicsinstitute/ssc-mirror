{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt power tworoc} computes sample size or power for a two-sample receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. 
When there is no correlation {cmd:corr(0)} between the two alternative AUCs ({it:auc1} and {it:auc2}), {opt power tworoc} 
computes sample size (power) for an independent two-sample test. When the correlation does not equal 0, {opt power tworoc} 
computes sample size (power) for a paired two-sample test. Variance functions are computed using either the method described 
in Obuchowski, Lieber and Wians (2004) for continuous and ordinal data assuming a binormal distribution (the default), or the method described by Hanley and McNeil (1982) 
for only continuous data which is based on the Mann-Whitney version of the rank-sum test. {cmd:power tworoc} is loosely based upon 
the code used in the SASÂ® macro ROCPOWER (Zepp 1995).



{title:Options}

{phang}
{opth a:lpha(numlist)} sets the significance level of the test.  The
default is {cmd:a:lpha(0.05)}.

{phang} 
{opth p:ower(numlist)} specifies the desired power at which sample size is to be computed. 
If {cmd:power()} is specified in conjunction with {cmd:n()}, {cmd:n1()}, or {cmd:n0()}, 
then the actual power of the test is presented.

{phang} 
{opth n(numlist)} specifies the number of subjects in the study to be used for determining power. For an independent two-sample
analysis {cmd:n()} indicates the total number of subjects taking one of the diagnostic tests (not the sum of both tests).

{phang}
{opth n1(numlist)} specifies the number of subjects in the diseased group to be used for determining power. For an independent two-sample
analysis {cmd:n1()} indicates the number of diseased patients taking one of the diagnostic tests (not the sum of both tests).

{phang} 
{opth n0(numlist)} specifies the number of subjects in the non-diseased group to be used for determining power. For an independent two-sample
analysis {cmd:n0()} indicates the number of non-diseased patients taking one of the diagnostic tests (not the sum of both tests).

{phang}
{opth ratio(numlist)} specifies the sample-size ratio of the non-diseased group relative to the diseased group, 
{cmd:N0/N1}. The default is {cmd:ratio(1)}, meaning equal allocation between the two groups.

{phang}
{opth corr(numlist)} specifies the hypothesized correlation between {it:auc1} and {it:auc2}. When the same patients
take both diagnostic tests, we expect a correlation between the AUCs. When different groups of patients take
the two diagnostic tests (i.e. independent samples), we expect the correlation to be 0. The default is 
{cmd:corr(0)}, meaning independent samples.

{phang} 
{opt onesid:ed} indicates a one-sided test. The default is two sided. 

{phang} 
{opt han:ley} uses the Hanley and McNeil (1982) method for computing the variance functions for continuous data.
The default is the method described by Obuchowski, Lieber, and Wians (2004) which is designed for use with 
continuous and ordinal data assuming a binormal distribution.

{title:Remarks: Using power tworoc}

{pstd}
{cmd:power tworoc} computes sample size or power for
a two-sample ROC analysis.  All computations are performed for a two-sided
hypothesis test where, by default, the significance level is set to 0.05. You
may change the significance level by specifying the {cmd:alpha()} option. You
can specify the {cmd:onesided} option to request a one-sided test.

{pstd}
To compute sample size, you must specify the AUCs under 
the null hypothesis ({it:auc0}) and the alternative hypotheses ({it:auc1} and {it:auc2}), 
and the power of the test in the {cmd:power()} option. The default power
is set to 0.80.  

{pstd}
To compute power, you must specify the sample size(s) in any of the {cmd:n()},
{cmd:n1()} or {cmd:n0()} options, along with the AUCs under the null and 
alternative hypotheses, {it:auc0}, {it:auc1} and {it:auc2}, respectively. 
{cmd:Note that for an independent two-sample test, the user specifies the n, n1 or n0 of only one of the two tests, not the total of the two tests combined}.

{pstd}
By default, the computed sample size is rounded up to the next integer.
