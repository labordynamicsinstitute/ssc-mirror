<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>pdplot</b> produces a Pareto dot plot as proposed by Wilkinson (2006).  The
    frequencies of the categories of <i>catvar</i> are shown in order by a series of
    dots against a magnitude scale. As backdrop, corresponding acceptance
    intervals are shown by bars.
<p>
    The command is more flexible than this description of default behaviour
    implies. The intervals can be suppressed and the dot plot can be recast()
    to another kind of twoway plot.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b> 
<p>
    Wilkinson (2006) briefly reviews Pareto charts which commonly combine two
    displays in one. Frequencies in various categories are shown by a series
    of bars arranged in frequency order, from most common downwards.  On that
    is often superimposed a rising curve showing cumulative frequency.
    Frequency and cumulative frequency may or may not have consistent scales.
    Examples from quality management studies often show categories of
    accidents, complaints, defects, failures, rejects, returns, or other such
    unwelcome phenomena. Wilkinson gives several cogent criticisms of this
    design and suggests an alternative: show frequencies in order, but by a
    dot plot, but add as reference a series of acceptance intervals.
<p>
    The acceptance intervals are calculated by simulation. Imagine as
    benchmark a population in which k categories are equally probable, and
    imagine taking samples of size n. Here k and n are the same as those in
    the data under consideration. Just by chance the observed frequencies of
    the k categories will typically differ. For each sample we can label the
    frequencies f_(1) &gt;= f_(2) &gt; ... &gt;= f_(k-1) &gt;= f_(k): thus f_(1) is the
    frequency of the most abundant category, and so forth. Across several
    samples we can get order statistics for each f_(j) and use those to
    calculate intervals with desired coverage.
<p>
    The acceptance intervals should not be overinterpreted, for various
    different reasons. First, the reference distribution is just an agnostic
    guess assuming that we know just the numbers of values and categories and
    that we have no reason to suppose that categories differ in probability.
    More commonly, we would not really expect that the categories are equal
    in probability; it is just that we would rarely know how to make our
    expectations precise. Second, although making the sample size bigger will
    stabilise results, some variability will always be experienced in
    intervals produced by simulation. Third, there are various slightly
    different recipes for producing percent points from order statistics and
    only one is wired in here.
<p>
    Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923) was an Italian sociologist, economist and
    philosopher, perhaps best remembered for his work on income distributions
    and what is now called Pareto efficiency.  See
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto.  Contrary to many
    statements, there appears to be no evidence that he used what is now
    known as the Pareto chart, which seems to have emerged in quality
    management after 1951. See Wilkinson (2006) for more on the latter point.
<p>
    Pareto charts are commonly shown as vertical bar charts with the awkward
    consequence that long text labels are aligned vertically or obliquely,
    and so made difficult to read. The <b>horizontal</b> option allows you to
    override the default.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b><u>ai</u></b><b>opts(</b><i>options</i><b>)</b> are options tuning the appearance of the acceptance
        intervals. Note that the default options are <b>barw(0.2) bcolor(none)</b>.
        The bars are laid down before the dots, so more colourful bars are
        possible. For comparison note that the bars are centred at ranks 1,
        2, etc., so that the default bar width is 20% of the possible.
<p>
    <b><u>dots</u></b><b>only</b> suppresses the simulation and the addition of acceptance
        intervals. In that case any <b>aiopts()</b>, <b>level()</b> or <b>nreps()</b> has no
        effect.
<p>
    <b><u>h</u></b><b>orizontal</b> specifies that the display should be aligned horizontally. The
        default is vertical. Note that <b>horizontal</b> with <b>recast()</b> works but is
        not useful.
<p>
    <b><u>l</u></b><b>evel(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies a coverage level as a percent for the acceptance
        intervals. The default is given by <b>c(level)</b>, which in turn defaults
        to 95. See help on level if desired.
<p>
    <b>nreps(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the number of repetitions of random drawing of a
        sample of size n from a population with k equally frequent
        categories. The default is 10000. For indicative, exploratory work,
        fewer repetitions may be adequate. Note that large numbers of
        repetitions, especially with large n, have implications for time and
        memory.  Positively, <b>pdplot</b> is most needed and most useful when the
        sample number is small. For reproducible results, set seed
        beforehand.
<p>
    <i>options</i> are other twoway options tuning the appearance of the graph. For
        example, note that a dot display is not compulsory and can be
        replaced using with the recast() option.
