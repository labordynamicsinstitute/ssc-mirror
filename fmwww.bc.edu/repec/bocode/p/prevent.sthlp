{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:prevent10} computes 10-year risk for coronary vascular disease (CVD), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and heart failure (HF). Similarly,
{cmd:prevent30} computes the 30-year risk for coronary vascular disease (CVD), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and heart failure (HF). The 
risk equations were developed by the American Heart Association Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Scientific Advisory Group and were derived 
and validated in a large, diverse sample of over 6 million individuals (Khan et al 2024). {cmd:prevent10} and {cmd:prevent30} produce risk estimates 
using the base model described in Khan et al (2024). 

{pstd}
{cmd:prevent10i} and {cmd:prevent30i} are the immediate forms of {cmd:prevent10} and {cmd:prevent30}, respectively; see {help immed}.



{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The risk for each outcome (CVD, ASCVD, HF) is calculated by separate models. Individuals may develop both ASCVD and HF. Therefore, the predicted risk of the 
components (ASCVD, HF) may be greater than the predicted risk of the composite outcome (CVD) [Khan et al 2024].
