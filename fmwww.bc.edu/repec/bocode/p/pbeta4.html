Probability plot for data compared with fitted beta distribution
----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^pbeta4^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [ ^,^ ^a^lpha^(^#^)^  ^b^eta^(^#^)
&gt; ^ ^gr^id
    graph_options ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^pbeta4^ produces a probability plot for varname compared with a
two-parameter beta distribution with shape parameters alpha and beta. By
default, alpha and beta are taken from S_2 and S_3, which is where
^beta4^ puts maximum likelihood estimates of them.
<p>
Note: this is the original version of ^pbeta^, written for Stata 4. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^pbeta^. 
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^alpha(^#^)^ sets alpha to #.
<p>
^beta(^#^)^ sets beta to #.
<p>
^grid^ is equivalent to ^yline(.25,.5,.75) xline(.25,.5,.75)^.
<p>
graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^; see
    help for ^graph^.
<p>
Example
-------
<p>
        . ^beta4 hail^
        . ^pbeta4 hail^
