Calculate the Proportional Reduction in Errors achieved by the model
.-
<p>
    ^pre^ [^, ^c^utoff(#) ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^pre^ is a post-estimation command that calculates the proportional reduction i
&gt; n 
errors achieved by the model.  pre is a measure of the predictive power of a mo
&gt; del.
This routine is simpler and is applicable to more models than lstat.
<p>
The approach of this procedure has three steps
1. find the errors when guessing without the model = E1 
2. find the errors when guessing what the model predicts = E2 
3. PRE = (E1-E2)/E1 */
<p>
For categorical dependent variables, the errors without the model are found by
guessing the mode.  The errors made without the model are: E1=N-Mode
<p>
For continuous dependent variables, the errors without the model are found by 
guessing the mean. The errors without the model are E1=(Y-Ybar)^2.  For OLS
models pre = R2.

Options
-------
    ^c^utoff(real) is the cutoff probability for logistic regression, i.e. the 
                   value above which the prediction is 1.  The default is 0.5.
