Probability plot for data compared with fitted gamma distribution
-----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^pgamma4^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [ ^,^ ^a^lpha^(^#^)^  ^b^eta^(^#^
&gt; )^ ^gr^id
    graph_options ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^pgamma4^ produces a probability plot for varname compared with a
two-parameter gamma distribution with shape parameter alpha and scale
parameter beta. By default, alpha and beta are taken from S_alpha and
S_beta, which is where ^gamma4^ puts maximum likelihood estimates of
them.
<p>
Note: this is the original version of ^pgamma^, written for Stata 4. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^pgamma^. 
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^alpha(^#^)^ sets alpha to #.
<p>
^beta(^#^)^ sets beta to #.
<p>
^grid^ is equivalent to ^yline(.25,.5,.75) xline(.25,.5,.75)^.
<p>
graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^; see
    help for ^graph^.
