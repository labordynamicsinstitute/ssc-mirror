{title:Description}

{pstd}
The {cmd:power roc} package is helpful for planning studies that use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests. 
An advantage of ROC curves for evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests is that it incorporates both {it: sensitivity} (the probability of a test detecting disease 
when the patient actually has the disease) and {it:specificity} (the probability that the test is negative when the patient is actually disease-free), into a single
measure of accuracy. {cmd:power roc} is loosely based upon the code used in the SASÂ® macro ROCPOWER (Zepp 1995). 

{pstd}
{opt power oneroc} computes sample size or power for a one-sample receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Variance functions 
are computed using either the method described in Obuchowski, Lieber and Wians (2004) for continuous and ordinal data assuming a binormal distibution (the default), 
or the method described by Hanley and McNeil (1982) for continuous data which is based on the Mann-Whitney version of the rank-sum test. 

{pstd}
{opt power tworoc} computes sample size or power for a two-sample receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. 
When there is no correlation {cmd:corr(0)} between the two alternative AUCs ({it:auc1} and {it:auc2}), {opt power tworoc} 
computes sample size (power) for an independent two-sample test. When the correlation does not equal 0, {opt power tworoc} 
computes sample size (power) for a paired two-sample test. As with {opt power oneroc}, variance functions are computed using either the method described 
in Obuchowski, Lieber and Wians (2004) for continuous and ordinal data assuming a binormal distribution (the default), or the method described by Hanley and McNeil (1982) 
for only continuous data which is based on the Mann-Whitney version of the rank-sum test.   

{pstd}
Sample size can be computed given power, and power can be computed given sample size. Results can be displayed in a table (default) and on a graph 
({helpb power_optgraph:[PSS-2] power, graph}).  


{title:Options}

{phang}
{opth a:lpha(numlist)} sets the significance level of the test.  The
default is {cmd:alpha(0.05)}.

{phang} 
{opth p:ower(numlist)} specifies the desired power at which sample size is to be computed. 
If {cmd:power()} is specified in conjunction with {cmd:n()}, {cmd:n1()}, or {cmd:n0()}, 
then the actual power of the test is presented.

{phang} 
{opth n(numlist)} specifies the total number of subjects in the study to be used for determining power. For an independent two-sample
analysis {cmd:n()} indicates the total number of subjects taking one of the diagnostic tests (not the sum of both tests).

{phang}
{opth n1(numlist)} specifies the number of subjects in the diseased group to be used for determining power. For an independent two-sample
analysis {cmd:n1()} indicates the number of diseased patients taking one of the diagnostic tests (not the sum of both tests).

{phang} 
{opth n0(numlist)} specifies the number of subjects in the non-diseased group to be used for determining power. For an independent two-sample
analysis {cmd:n0()} indicates the number of non-diseased patients taking one of the diagnostic tests (not the sum of both tests).

{phang}
{opth ratio(numlist)} specifies the sample-size ratio of the non-diseased group relative to the diseased group, 
{cmd:N0/N1}. The default is {cmd:ratio(1)}, meaning equal allocation between the two groups.

{phang}
{opth corr(numlist)} specifies the hypothesized correlation between {it:auc1} and {it:auc2} ({cmd:power tworoc} only). When the same patients
take both diagnostic tests, we expect a correlation between the AUCs. When different groups of patients take
the two diagnostic tests (i.e. independent samples), we expect the correlation to be 0. The default is 
{cmd:corr(0)}, meaning independent samples.

{phang} 
{opt onesid:ed} indicates a one-sided test. The default is two sided. 

{phang} 
{opt han:ley} uses the Hanley and McNeil (1982) method for computing the variance functions for continuous data.
The default is the method described by Obuchowski, Lieber, and Wians (2004) which is designed for use with 
continuous and ordinal data assuming a binormal distribution.
