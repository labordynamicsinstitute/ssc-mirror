    <b>pajek2stata </b>--  Import network data in Pajek's .net format
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
<p>
        <b>pajek2stata</b> using <i>fname</i> <b>,</b> <b>name(</b><i>name</i><b>)</b> [<b>clear replace</b>]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>pajek2stata</b> imports data stored in Pajek's ".net" format for relational
    data. A .net file is an ASCII file consisting of two parts.  The first
    part contains information about the vertices in the network, in the
    conventional observation-by-variable format.  The first column of the
    vertices part must contain the identifiers for the vertices; optional
    additional columns may contain vertex labels and other properties of the
    vertices. pajek2stata stores this part into new Stata variables. By
    default, these variables are named var1, var2..etc., because Pajek net
    files do not contain variable names.  The new variables are all stored as
    string variables, and can be converted afterwards as needed.
<p>
    The second part of the file contains the data on relations between the
    vertecis, i.e., the network. The network data may take three different
    formats:
<p>
    <i>Matrix:</i> The data are stored as a square NxN adjacency matrix.
<p>
    <i>Edges:</i> The data are stored as a <i>list</i> of <i>edges</i>, in which every line in the
        data represents a relation between two vertices. The first two values
        must contain the identifiers of the vertices; a third (optional)
        value may contain the value of the relation.
<p>
    <i>Arcs:</i> The data are stored as a <i>list</i> of <i>arcs</i>, in which every line in the
        data represents a directed a relation <i>from</i> one vertex <i>to</i> another. The
        first two values must contain the identifiers of the vertices; a
        third (optional) value may contain the value of the relation.
<p>
    pajek2stata stores the relational part of the data as a matrix in Mata,
    from where it may be analyzed further.
<p>
    Note: this version of pajek2stata can only handle simple .net files
    containing not more than one network specification.  Pajek also supports
    .net files with multiple network specifications for the same set of
    vertices. Future versions of pajek2stata may be able to deal with such
    files.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<p>
    <b>name()</b> is required: specifies the name of the Mata matrix in which the
        relational data are to be stored.
<p>
    <b>clear</b> specifies that the memory is to be cleared before the data are
        loaded. pajek2stata issues an error message if there are already data
        in memory and "clear" is not specified.
<p>
    <b>replace</b> specifies that if the Mata matrix<i> name</i> already exists, it is to
        be replaced.
