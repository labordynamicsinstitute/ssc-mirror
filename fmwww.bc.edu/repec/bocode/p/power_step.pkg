d 'POWER_STEP': module to compute power for a step intervention with AR(1) Error
d
d  power_step computes power for an interrupted time series
d analysis (ITSA) in which the intervention is expected to change
d the level (step) of the series (McLeod and Vingilis 2008). The
d results are computed in terms of the size of the intervention
d effect in units corresponding to standard deviations of the
d pre-intervention series (presented as the scaled intervention
d parameter Î´). The power estimates assume that the intervention
d analysis will be performed using an autoregressive moving-average
d (ARMA) model. The computations and output of power_step largely
d mirror those found at

d ml.  However, there are cases in which the results between the
d online calculator and power_step slightly differ. This is due to
d the fact that Javascript does not naturally compute the
d cumulative standard distribution function (CDF) and therefore the
d author uses an approximation. Conversely, power_step uses
d normal() to compute the CDF.
