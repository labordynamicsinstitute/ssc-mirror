Probability plot for data compared with fitted Weibull distribution
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^pweibull4^ varname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range]
    [ ^,^ ^b(^#^)^  ^c(^#^)^ ^gr^id graph_options ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^pweibull4^ produces a probability plot for varname compared with a
two-parameter Weibull distribution with scale parameter b and shape
parameter c. By default, b and c are taken from S_2 and S_3, which is
where ^wbull^ puts maximum likelihood estimates of them.
<p>
The probability density function is
<p>
             c         c - 1               c
    f(x) =   -  (x / b)       exp(- (x / b) )
             b
<p>
for x &gt;= 0, b &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0.
<p>
Note: this is the original version of ^pweibull^, written for Stata 4. 
Users of Stata 8 up should switch to ^pweibull^. 
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^b(^#^)^ sets b to #.
<p>
^c(^#^)^ sets c to #.
<p>
^grid^ adds grid lines at the .05, .10, .25, .50, .75, .90, and .95
    quantiles.
<p>
graph_options are any of the options allowed with ^graph, twoway^; see
    help for ^graph^.
