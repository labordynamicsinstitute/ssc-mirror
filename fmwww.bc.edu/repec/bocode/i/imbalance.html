<b>Description</b>
<b>-----------</b>
 
<b>imbalance</b> calculates absolute standardized difference in 
covariate means (ASAM) before matching (dx) and after matching
(dxm), as described by Haviland, Nagin, and Rosenbaum (2007). 
It allows the analyst to evaluate whether matching balances an 
observed covariate between treated and control observations.  
<b>dataname</b> specifies the name of data file containing covariates 
to be checked. <b>varname</b> is the name of a covariate on which the 
analyst wants to check its balance between treated and control 
observations. <b>treatname</b> specifies the name of the dichotomous 
variable identifying treatment conditions. For <b>imbalance</b> to run 
properly, <b>treatname</b> must be coded treatname = 1 if the observation
receives treatment, and treatname = 0 if the observation is a control. 
<b>blockname</b> specifies the variable name that identifies matched sets.
 
 
<b>Output and Return Values</b>
<b>------------------------</b>
 
After running <b>imbalance</b>, Stata returns <b>dx</b> ¨C the absolute 
standardized difference in covariate means before matching, 
<b>dxm</b> - the absolute standardized difference in covariate means 
after matching, and the <b>name</b> of the covariate along with the 
blockname. Both dx and dxm are similar to Cohen¡¯s d. After running 
imbalance, Stata saves the results in a file named <b>savfile</b>. 
The analyst can use <b> return list</b> immediately after running 
<b>imbalance</b> to see statistics saved for further analysis.
