^Calculation of ICC Models 2 and 3^
^---------------------------------^
<p>
        .^icc23^ &lt;dv&gt; &lt;classvar&gt; &lt;within_var&gt;, MOdel(#) LEvel(#)
<p>
<p>
^Description^
^-----------^
<p>
^icc23^ computes the intra-class correlation for random effects models based on
&gt;  repeated
measures ANOVA.  These models are ICC[2,1], ICC[2,k], ICC[3,1], and ICC[3,k], a
&gt; s described
by Shrout and Fleiss, 1979 (see reference below).  (For the ICC[1,1] and ICC[1,
&gt; k] models
based on a one-way ANOVA, see @loneway@).  ^icc23^ runs a repeated measures ANO
&gt; VA to derive
the appropriate estimates and degrees of freedom.  In the event there is a sign
&gt; ificant F-test
for the ^classvar^ (e.g., a significant differernce among raters), the program 
&gt; will provide
the p-value from the ANOVA table.
<p>
Data must be in the "long" format.  If not, use the @reshape@ command to reconf
&gt; igure the data.
<p>
Four types of ICC models are considered:
<p>
        ICC[2,1]:  reflects the case where the same group of subjects is rated 
&gt; by k raters,
                   interest is in the reliability of individual scores.  In thi
&gt; s model, raters
                   are considered a representative sample of a population of si
&gt; milar raters. This
                   model is a two-way random effects model.
<p>
        ICC[2,k]:  is the same approach as ICC[2,1] above, but interest is in t
&gt; he reliability
                   of the MEAN score, rather than among single observations.
<p>
        ICC[3,1]:  reflects the case where the same group of subjects is rated 
&gt; by k raters,
                   interest is in the reliability of individual scores.  In thi
&gt; s model, the only
                   raters of interest are those participating in the study (e.g
&gt; ., there is no 
                   intention of generalizing the raters' scores to a larger pop
&gt; ulation of raters).
                   This model is considered a "mixed" model (subjects are rando
&gt; m, raters are fixed). 
                  
        ICC[3,k]:  is the same approach as ICC[3,1] above, but interest is in t
&gt; he reliability
                   of the MEAN score, rather than among single observations.
<p>
Three inputs are required:
<p>
            dv     is the dependent variable
<p>
         classvar  the class variable refers to factor that is repeated within 
&gt; subjects, e.g., raters,
                   devices, time points, etc., e.g., the variable which would b
&gt; e entered as the 
                   repeated() variable in the ANOVA option.
<p>
       within_var  refers to the "within subject" variable, e.g., subjects bein
&gt; g assessed
   
<p>
^NOTE:  The order of entry of the variables is critical!^  
<p>
<p>
<p>
^Options^
^-------^
       ^MO^del(#)  refers to the type of model to be estimated.  ICC model 2 is
&gt;  the default (
                 producing ICC[2,1] and ICC[2,k] estimates).
       
       ^LE^vel(#)  the degree of precision of the confidence interval, entered 
&gt; as a decimal.
                 The default is 95%, i.e., level(.95)
                
<p>
Examples
--------
<p>
For ICC[2,1] and ICC[2,k]: Two-way random effects (Subjects and raters are cons
&gt; idered to be
                           sampled from larger populations); 95% CIs are assume
&gt; d. 
                
^.icc23 score rater person_id^
<p>
<p>
<p>
For ICC[3,1] and ICC[3,k]: Two-way mixed model: Subjects are random, but raters
&gt;  are fixed 
                           (i.e., the raters are not considered a sample -- the
&gt; y are the 
                           only raters of interest); 90% CIs are requested.
                
^.icc23 score rater person_id, model(3) level(.90)^
