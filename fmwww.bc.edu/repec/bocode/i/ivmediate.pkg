d 'IVMEDIATE': module to perform Causal mediation analysis in instrumental-variables regressions
d
d  ivmediate implements the causal mediation analysis framework for
d linear IV models introduced by Dippel et al. (2019). It estimates
d three effects: i) the total effect of a single treatment T on an
d outcome Y, where T is instrumented with a single IV Z, that is, a
d variable that affects Y only through T, ii) the direct effect of
d T on Y net of the effect of a mediator variable M, and iii) the
d indirect effect (mediation effect) of a third variable M through
d which T affects Y. The command allows for unpacking the treatment
d effect from a standard IV regression into the direct and indirect
d effects of (potentially) endogenous treatment and mediator
d variables without the need for an additional instrument for the
d mediator variable. This compares with frameworks that require an
d instrument for the mediator (Fr√∂lich and Huber 2017; Jun et al.
d 2016) or those where random assignment of the treatment is
d assumed (Imai, Keele, and Tingley 2010).
