Description
- -----------
<p>
^istdize^ produces indirectly standardized rates using a standard population.
This standardization methods is indicated in situations where the
stratum-specific rates for the population being studied are either unavailable
or are based on small numbers and thus unreliable.  The standardization
utilizes the stratum-specific rates of a standard population to calculate the
expected number of cases in the study population(s), sums them and then
compares them to the actual number of cases observed.  The standard
population's information must be contained in another Stata data file and
specified via ^using^ on the command line.
<p>
^casevar^ is the variable name for the study population's number of cases
(deaths). It must be an integer and it must have the same value for all
observations or missing in all but one observation in each subpopulation
identified by the ^groupvars^.
<p>
^popvar^ identifies the number of subjects represented by each observation in
the study population.
<p>
^stratavars^ define the strata. 
<p>
Options
- -------
<p>
^by(^groupvars^)^ it specifies the variables identifying the study populations
if more than one exist in the data.
<p>
^popvars(^case_vars pop_var^)^ or ^rate(^rate_var #|crude_var^)^ must be
specified.  Only one of these two options is allowed.  These options are used
to describe the standard population's data where:
<p>
         Variables used with ^rate^ option:
         ^rate_var^    variable containing the strata specific rates.
         ^#|crude_var^ is used to specify the crude case rate either via a
                       variable name or optionally by its value.  If the crude
                       rate variable is used it must be the same for all
                       observations or missing in all but one.
<p>
         Variables used with ^popvars^ option:
         ^case_vars^   variable for the number of cases (deaths) for
                       each stratum in the standard population.
          ^pop_var^i   variable representing the total number of individuals
                       in each stratum (individuals at risk).
<p>
^print^ outputs a tabulate summary of the standard population before
outputting the study populations.
<p>
^format(%^fmt^)^ specifies the format to use for displaying the summary table.
The default is ^%10.0g^; see help @%fmt@.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for the confidence
interval of the adjusted rate; see help @level@.
