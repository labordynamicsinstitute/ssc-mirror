<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>icdpic</b> -- International Classification of Diseases Programs for Injury
        Categorization
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Version</u></b>
<p>
    Version 3.0.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  ICDPIC Version 3.0 has
    been tested in STATA 10 and STATA 11, but the authors believe it should
    also work without incident in STATA 8 and STATA 9.  If you have any
    problems using ICDPIC Version 3.0 in STATA 8 or STATA 9, please inform
    the authors.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 may be installed from within STATA using the <b>ssc</b>
    command.  If you installed a previous version of ICDPIC from the SSC
    archives website using the <b>ssc</b> command, we suggest that you first delete
    it by typing <b>ssc uninstall icdpic</b> followed by <b>ssc install icdpic</b>.
    Alternatively, you may use <b>ssc install icdpic, replace</b>.  See help for 
    ssc.
<p>
    If you installed any previous ICDPIC files obtained directly from the
    authors, please delete them <b>ALL</b> (.ado, .hlp and .dta files) to avoid any
    conflicts with ICDPIC 3.0 files.
<p>
    Please enter complete variable names in the ICDPIC Version 3.0 dialog
    boxes.  Do not use abbreviations.
<p>
    New to Version 3.0 is the addition of a dialog box (.dlg) file associated
    with each individual ICDPIC Version 3.0 program (.ado) file.  To access
    the ICDPIC dialog box, and all the ICDPIC programs, type: <b>db icdpic</b>.
    Typing <b>icdpic</b>, as in earlier versions, will still work, but <b>ONLY</b> with
    <b>icdpic</b>.  Forgetting to precede any other individual program name with <b>db</b>
    will produce an error.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to use path\file names
    containing spaces.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to run in STATA 11.0.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is a bug that caused the <b>triss</b> program to
    crash if the <i>rts</i> variable was named anything other than "rts".
<p>
    New in ICDPIC Version 3.0 (<b>trauma</b> program only) is the ability to choose
    whether an AIS value of 6 automatically forces an ISS of 75 or to
    automatically have all AIS values of 6 changed to an AIS value of 5 and
    then have the ISS calculated normally.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have memory.  Each time a dialog
    box is opened within the same STATA session, it will remember the values
    last entered.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have the following buttons:
<p>
      <i>OK</i> executes the program and removes the dialog box from the screen.
<p>
      <i>SUBMIT</i> executes the program and leaves the dialog box on the screen.
             Note that if an error message is generated the dialog box may be
             minimized.
<p>
      <i>CANCEL</i> removes the dialog box from the screen and does nothing.
             Clicking on the close icon of the dialog box does the same
             thing.
<p>
      <i>HELP</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and presents the program help
           file.  The <i>HELP</i> button has a question mark on it.
<p>
      <i>COPY</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and copies the program command
           to the clipboard.
<p>
      <i>RESET</i> resets the values of the controls in the dialog box to their
            initial state, just as if the dialog box were invoked for the
            first time.  Each time a user invokes a dialog box, its controls
            will be filled in with the values the user last entered.  <i>RESET</i>
            restores the control values to their defaults.  The <i>RESET</i> button
            has an R on it.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>db icdpic</b>
<p>
    The <i>ICDPIC</i> dialog box will open.  Click on the radio button next to the
    desired program and then click <i>OK</i> or <i>Submit</i>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    The <b>db icdpic</b> command presents to the user the master dialog box used to
    access the International Classification of Diseases Programs for Injury
    Categorization (IDCPIC).  ICDPIC programs, and their associated lookup
    tables, were developed using Stata (Version 7, StataCorp, College Station
    TX) for records containing ICD-9-CM codes.  We intentionally used an
    older version of Stata (currently up to Version 11), so that users with
    older versions could still have access to the programs.  The current
    version (3.0) requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  The intention of ICDPIC
    described here is to provide inexpensive methods for translating
    International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes into
    standard injury categories and/or scores.  Initial development of these
    programs occurred as part of research projects funded by the National
    Center for Injury Prevention and Control through the Harvard Injury
    Control Research Center (CDC R49/CCR 115279) and by the Maine Medical
    Center Research Strategic Plan.  The authors are grateful for this
    support and would also appreciate suggestions or corrections from any
    user of the software.  Publications of studies in which these programs or
    tables are used should cite the authors.  We hope ICDPIC will make
    ICD-9-CM codes easier to use for injury research, and facilitate
    comparison of categorization methods.  Modification of lookup tables
    could allow easy conversion to ICD-10-CM, and empirically-derived scores
    (like ICISS) can be updated using newer reference databases.
<p>
    A list of programs to which ICDPIC provides access is found below:
<p>
<p>
    <b>trauma</b> provides various classifications and characterizations of trauma
    based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, specifically codes for Nature of
    Injury (N-Codes) and External Cause of Injury (E-Codes).
<p>
    <b>srr</b> calculates the survival risk ratio (SRR) and the independent survival
    risk ratio (SRRi) for all valid ICD-9-CM injury codes (N-Codes) in a data
    set and stores them in a file on disk.
<p>
    <b>iciss</b> calculates ICISS (ICD-9 based Injury Severity Score) using both
    survival risk ratios (SRR's) and independent survival risk ratios
    (SRRl's).
<p>
    <b>aps</b> calculates the anatomic profile score (APS).
<p>
    <b>rts</b> calculates the revised trauma score (RTS).
<p>
    <b>triss</b>, A Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), estimates patient
    survival probability.
<p>
    <b>ascot</b>, A Severity Characterization of Trauma (ASCOT), estimates patient
    survival probability.
<p>
    <b>icd9tmpm</b>, A Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (ICD-9-CM TMPM), ICD-9-CM
    version.
<p>
    <b>ais_tmpm</b>, A Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (AIS TMPM), AIS version for
    those with AIS codes only.
<p>
    <b>altcharl</b> determines which Charlson comorbidities are present, the number
    of Charlson comorbidities present and the Charlson score.
<p>
    <b>elixhaus</b> determines which Elixhauser comorbidities are present and the
    number of Elixhauser comorbidities present.
<p>
<p>
    On a general note, observations in the user's data must be in Stata
    "wide" format, for example:
<p>
<p>
    <b>ident</b>    <b>dx1</b>     <b>dx2</b>     <b>dx3</b>
<p>
    31416   800.1   959.9   E910.9
    31417   800.24  410.0
<p>
<p>
    Use the Stata "wide" command (see help for reshape) to obtain this format
    if the observations are originally recorded in "long" format, for
    example:
<p>
<p>
    <b>ident</b>    <b>diagnosis</b>
<p>
    31416     800.16
    31416     959.9
    31416     E910.9
    31417     800.24
    31417     410.0
<p>

<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>BACKGROUND</u></b>
<p>
    Administrative databases and registries often describe specific injuries
    using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which has gone
    from its Eighth Revision through its Tenth Revision over the past few
    decades.
<p>
    Sacco and colleagues tabulated the observed hospital mortality for
    patients with each diagnosis code, and assigned each patient an Anatomic
    Index (AI) equal to the maximum of the observed mortality probabilities
    for that patient's injury diagnoses.  Levy and colleagues similarly
    tabulated the observed hospital survival for patients with each diagnosis
    code, and assigned each patient an Estimated Survival Probability (ESP)
    equal to the product of the observed survival probabilities for that
    patient's injury diagnoses.  A variation of the latter approach, the
    ICD-9-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS), was popularized years later by
    Osler and colleagues.
<p>
    The Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) had
    been previously introduced for clinical studies, and have remained the
    most popular and most familiar way to describe injury severity, although
    they were not originally defined in terms of ICD diagnoses.  Later, Copes
    and colleagues described an Anatomic Profile, specified in part by ICD
    codes, and Osler and colleagues described a New Injury Severity Score
    (NISS), but these generally failed to displace the AIS or ISS in popular
    use.
<p>
    More recently, Barell and an international group of colleagues developed
    a matrix of ICD-9-CM codes to classify injury diagnoses by type and
    anatomic region; these authors did not relate these categories to
    severity, although it is possible to do so.  Another innovation is the
    Trauma Mortality Prediction Model, which uses a new approach based on AIS
    or ICD-9-CM codes as described by Osler et al.
<p>
    Translating ICD codes into AIS codes (and from there to ISS or NISS if
    desired) was considered with the Eighth Revision of ICD, but only became
    practical with the increased precision of the ICD Ninth Revision Clinical
    Modification (ICD-9-CM).  A program to make this conversion was further
    developed with federal grant support at the Johns Hopkins School of
    Hygiene and Public Health, and was subsequently marketed as ICDMAP-90 by
    the Tri-Analytics Corporation of Bel Air, Maryland.  Since 2001,
    Tri-Analytics is no longer responsible for this software, although it is
    still available through Johns Hopkins (according to 
    http://www.trianalytics.com/pdfs/dataspeak_v8n2.pdf).  ICDMAP-90 deserves
    credit for providing a standard method of ICD to AIS conversion for the
    past two decades.  However, it uses proprietary algorithms that are not
    explicitly stated for the user, and some newer ICD-9-CM codes are not
    recognized by the program.
<p>
    Anatomic ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes are sometimes called Nature of Injury
    codes or N-codes.  External Cause of Injury codes in ICD-9 (E-codes)
    refer to the mechanism of injury, such as vehicle crash or gunshot.  The
    CDC has published a suggested categorization of ICD-9 E-codes by
    mechanism as well as intent.
<p>
    The Revised Trauma Score (RTS) uses physiologic information (not
    available from ICD-9-CM codes) to predict survival after injury.  The
    Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) derives a "Probability of
    Survival" equation from ISS, RTS, and an age indicator variable (equal to
    0 for age &lt;= 54 and 1 otherwise).  Separate equations have been used for
    penetrating or blunt injuries.  ASCOT is an alternative scale based on
    the Anatomic Profile, which has generally not been as popular as TRISS.
<p>
    ICD-9-CM codes potentially relating to pre-existing medical conditions
    may be identified according to the inclusion criteria of Charlson et al,
    with the "Dartmouth/Manitoba" modifications described by Romano et al.
    The "Charlson Score" adds weights of 6 for the presence of AIDS or
    metastatic solid tumor, 3 for severe liver disease, 2 for any malignancy,
    renal failure, or complications of diabetes, and 1 for other conditions.
    A more detailed method has been developed by Elixhauser et al but has not
    been widely used in trauma patients.

    <b><u>LOOKUP TABLES</u></b>
<p>
    Lookup tables are provided for use with the <b>trauma</b>, <b>icd9tmpm</b>, <b>ais_tmpm</b>,
    <b>altcharl</b>, <b>elixhaus</b> and <b>srr</b> programs.  If the user wishes to modify these
    tables, or provide their own, they must be sorted on the diagnosis code
    variable (DRG variable for table <b>drgtab_h.dta</b>; predot variable for table
    <b>mais_s.dta</b>).  All lookup tables are current through September 30, 2008,
    except for ntab_s1.dta and ntab_s2.dta, which are current through
    September 30, 2011, barring any late additions and/or corrections.  New
    tables for etab_s1.dta and etab_s2.dta will be provided when a new
    recommended framework for presenting injury mortality data is issued.
<p>
    The tables for use with the <b>trauma</b> program are:

            category
        <i>severity</i>: AIS severity
        <i>issbr</i>: ISS body region
        <i>apc</i>: Anatomic profile component category
<p>
<p>
    Nature of Injury Codes (N-Codes) included in both <b>ntab_s1.dta</b> and
    <b>ntab_s2.dta</b>:

    ISS body region and AIS severity codes for lookup tables <b>ntab_s1.dta</b> and
    <b>ntab_s2.dta</b> were created by analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank
    (NTDB).  The NTDB contains more than 2 million patient records compiled
    by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma from hundreds of
    contributing hospitals (see http://www.facs.org/trauma/ntdb.html for
    further information).  ICDPIC does not attempt to assign a specific AIS
    code for each ICD-9-CM diagnosis code, but only to classify injuries
    (N-Codes) into a general severity and body region in order to allow for
    approximate severity scoring.  For ICDPIC, we associated each N-Code in
    the NTDB (Version 6.1) with the ISS body region and AIS severity for the
    same injury most frequently selected by trauma registrars submitting data
    to the NTDB.  For the few N-Codes that never appeared in association with
    an AIS code, the authors assigned a body region and AIS score by
    consensus.  N-Codes relating to burn injuries were not coded for AIS
    severity.  Instead, an AIS severity value of 9 (Unknown) was assigned.
