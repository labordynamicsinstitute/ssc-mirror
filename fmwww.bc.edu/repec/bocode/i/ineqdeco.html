<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>ineqdeco</b> and <b>ineqdec0</b> estimate a range of inequality and related indices
    commonly used by economists, plus decompositions of a subset of these
    indices by population subgroup.  Inequality decompositions by subgroup
    are useful for providing inequality profiles at a point in time, and also
    for analyzing secular trends using shift-share analysis. Unit record
    (`micro' level) data are required. Observations with values of <i>varname</i>
    less than or equal to zero are excluded from calculations using <b>ineqdeco</b>.
    By contrast, calculations using <b>ineqdec0</b> do not exclude these
    observations: values of <i>varname</i> less than or equal to zero are valid
    (unless otherwise excluded using the <b>if</b> or <b>in</b> options). As a consequence,
    the portfolio of indices that is estimated by <b>ineqdec0</b> is restricted.
    See below for details.
<p>
    Inequality indices estimated by <b>ineqdeco</b> are: members of the single
    parameter Generalized Entropy class GE(a) for a = -1, 0, 1, 2; the
    Atkinson class A(e) for e = 0.5, 1, 2; the Gini coefficient, and the
    percentile ratios p90 / p10 and p75 / p25.  Also presented are related
    summary statistics such as subgroup means and population shares.
    Optionally presented are indices related to the Atkinson inequality
    indices, namely equally-distributed-equivalent income Yede(e), social
    welfare indices W(e), and the Sen welfare index: see below for details.
    The indices estimated by <b>ineqdec0</b> are the percentile ratios p90/p10 and
    p75/p25, GE(2) = half the squared coefficient of variation, the Gini
    coefficient, and Sen's welfare index.
<p>
    The inequality indices differ in their sensitivities to income
    differences in different parts of the distribution. The more positive a
    is, the more sensitive GE(a) is to income differences at the top of the
    distribution; the more negative a is, the more sensitive it is to
    differences at the bottom of the distribution. GE(0) is the mean
    logarithmic deviation, GE(1) is the Theil index, and GE(2) is half the
    square of the coefficient of variation. The more positive e &gt; 0 (the
    'inequality aversion parameter') is, the more sensitive A(e) is to income
    differences at the bottom of the distribution. The Gini coefficient is
    most sensitive to income differences about the middle (more precisely,
    the mode).
<p>
    For textbook reviews of inequality measurement from the perspective of
    economists, see Cowell (1995) or Jenkins (1991). See also Cowell (2000).
    On the characterization of Generalized Entropy indices, and their
    subgroup decomposability properties, see e.g.  Shorrocks (1984) and
    references therein. On the Atkinson indices, see Atkinson (1970).  The
    decomposition of Atkinson indices is discussed by Blackorby et al.
    (1981).  For extensive empirical illustrations of inequality index
    decomposition, see inter alia Jenkins (1995) who also applies the
    decomposition of inequality trends proposed by Mookherjee and Shorrocks
    (1982). Cowell and Jenkins (1995) compare decompositions based on
    Generalized Entropy and Atkinson indices.  The welfare indices estimated
    here are discussed by Sen (1976), and Jenkins (1997) who also provides
    empirical illustrations.
<p>
    <i>groupvar</i> must take non-negative integer values only. To create such a
    variable from an existing variable, use the egen function <b>group</b>.  By
    default, observations with missing values on <i>groupvar</i> are excluded from
    calculations when the <b>bygroup</b> option is specified. If you wish to include
    them, create a new variable with the egen function <b>group</b> and use its
    <b>missing</b> option. The egen function <b>group</b> is also useful for multi-way
    decompositions. E.g. for a decomposition by sex and region, create a new
    <i>groupvar</i> defining sex-region combinations by specifying sex and region in
    <b>group(</b><i>varlist</i><b>)</b>.
<p>
    Bootstrapped standard errors for the estimates of the indices can be
    derived using bootstrap. Standard errors derived using linearization
    methods can be calculated for GE(a) using <b>svygei</b>, for A(e) using <b>svyatk</b>,
    and for the Gini using <b>svylorenz</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Technical details</u></b>
<p>
    Consider a population of persons (or households ...), i = 1,...,n, with
    income y_i, and weight w_i. Let f_i = w_i / N, where N = SUM w_i.  (In
    what follows all sums are over all values of whatever is subscripted.)
    When the data are unweighted, w_i = 1 and N = n.
<p>
    Arithmetic mean income is m. Suppose there is an exhaustive partition of
    the population into mutually-exclusive subgroups k = 1,...,K.
<p>
    The Generalized Entropy class of inequality indices is given by
<p>
        GE(a) = [1 / (a (a - 1)] { [SUM f_i (y_i / m)^a] - 1 },
        a != 0 and a != 1,
<p>
        GE(1) = SUM f_i (y_i / m) log(y_i / m),
<p>
        GE(0) = SUM f_i log(m / y_i).
<p>
    Each GE(a) index can be additively decomposed as
<p>
        GE(a) = GE_W(a) + GE_B(a)
<p>
    where GE_W(a) is Within-group Inequality and GE_B(a) is Between-Group
    Inequality and
<p>
        GE_W(a) = SUM [v_k^(1-a)] . [s_k^a] . GE_k(a)
<p>
    where v_k = N_k / N is the number of persons in subgroup k divided by the
    total number of persons (subgroup population share), and s_k is the share
    of total income held by k's members (subgroup income share).  (Strictly
    speaking, v_k is the sum of the weights in subgroup k divided by the sum
    of the weights for the full estimation sample.)
<p>
    GE_k(a), inequality for subgroup k, is calculated as if the subgroup were
    a separate population, and GE_B(a) is derived assuming every person
    within a given subgroup k received k's mean income, m_k.
<p>
    Define the equally-distributed-equivalent income
<p>
        Yede(e) = [SUM f_i (y_i)^(1-e)]^(1 / (1 - e)), e &gt; 0 and  e != 1,
<p>
                = exp( SUM f_i . log y_i ), e = 1.
<p>
    The Atkinson indices are defined by
<p>
        A(e) = 1 - Yede(e) / m.
<p>
    These indices are decomposable (but not additively decomposable):
<p>
        A(e) = A_W(a) + A_B(a) - A_W(a) . A_B(a)
<p>
    where
<p>
        A_W(a) = 1 - [SUM (v_k) .  Yede_k / m] and
<p>
        A_B(a) = 1 - Yede / [SUM v_k. Yede_k ].
<p>
    Social welfare indices are defined by
<p>
        W(e) = [Yede(e)^(1-e)] / (1 - e), e &gt; 0, e != 1;
<p>
        W(1) = log Yede(1).
<p>
    Each of these welfare indices is an increasing function of a `generalized
    mean of order (1 - e)', Yede(e).  All the welfare indices are additively
    decomposable:
<p>
        W(e) = SUM v_k W_k(e).
<p>
    The Gini coefficient is given by
<p>
        G = 1 + (1 / N) - [2/(m . N^2)] [SUM (N - i + 1) y_i]
<p>
    where persons are ranked in ascending order of y_i.  The Gini coefficient
    (and the percentile ratios) cannot be written as the sum of a term
    summarizing within-group inequality and a term summarizing between-group
    inequality.
<p>
    Sen's (1976) welfare index is given by
<p>
        S = m(1 - G).
<p>
<p>

    attention to a bug in the subgroup decomposition calculations that arose
    when if/in qualifiers led to no observations in one of more of the by
