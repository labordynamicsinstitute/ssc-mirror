<b><u>Calculate Durbin-Wu-Hausman endogeneity test after </u></b><b><u>ivreg</u></b>
<p>
        <b>ivendog</b> [<i>varlist</i>]
<p>
<b>ivendog</b> is for use after <b>ivreg</b> or <b>ivreg2</b>; see help ivreg or help ivreg2 (if
installed).  The test is not valid with pweights, nor with the robust or
cluster options of the original estimator, and will not be performed in these
circumstances.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>ivendog</b> computes a test for endogeneity in a regression estimated via
instrumental variables (IV), the null hypothesis for which states that an
ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the same equation would yield
consistent estimates: that is, any endogeneity among the regressors would not
have deleterious effects on OLS estimates. A rejection of the null indicates
that endogenous regressors' effects on the estimates are meaningful, and
instrumental variables techniques are required. The test was first proposed by
Durbin (1954) and separately by Wu (1973) (his T4 statistic) and Hausman
(1978). This "Durbin-Wu-Hausman" (DWH) test is numerically equivalent to the
standard "Hausman test" obtained using hausman with the sigmamore option, in
which both forms of the model must be estimated. Under the null, it is
distributed Chi-squared with m degrees of freedom, where m is the number of
regressors specified as endogenous in the original instrumental variables
regression.
<p>
The <b>ivendog</b> output also contains another test statistic: the "Wu-Hausman" T2
statistic of Wu (1973). Hausman (1978) showed that the test could be calculated
straightforwardly through the use of auxiliary regressions.  The test
statistic, under the null, is distributed F(m,N-k), where m is the number of
regressors specified as endogenous in the original instrumental variables
regression. A rejection indicates that the instrumental variables estimator
should be employed. See Davidson and MacKinnon (1993, p. 237-240) and
Wooldridge (2000, p. 483-484).
<p>
If the constant was excluded from <b>ivreg</b> or <b>ivreg2</b>, it will be excluded from the
auxiliary regression.
<p>
As Davidson and MacKinnon (1993, p. 241-242) discuss, the test may be applied
to a subset of the endogenous variables, maintaining those not specified as
endogenous. In this form, the <i>varlist</i> contains those variables which are to be
tested, and the degrees of freedom for the test refer to the number of
variables listed.
<p>
These tests may also be computed by the orthog option of <b>ivreg2</b>.  Although
<b>ivendog</b> may not be applied to robust nor cluster estimates, <b>ivreg2</b> may also be
used to perform a heteroskedasticity-robust form of the test in either context,
as well as in the GMM context.
<p>
The underlying computations for these tests are described in much greater
detail in Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman (2003).
