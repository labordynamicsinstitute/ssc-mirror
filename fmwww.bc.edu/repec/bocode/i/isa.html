<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    -<b>isa</b>- produces a figure for the sensitivity analysis developed by Imbens
    (2003).  Observational studies cannot control for the bias due to the
    omission of unobservables.  The sensitivity analysis provides a benchmark
    about how strong assumption about unobservables researchers need to make
    to maintain the causal interpretation.
<p>
    Specifically, Imbens (2003) set up the situation in which researchers can
    manipulate the magnitude of the bias by changing the coefficient of an
    unobservable on a treatment variable (<b>alpha</b>) and that on an outcome
    variable (<b>delta</b>).  Thus, there exist a number of pairs of <b>alpha</b> and <b>delta</b>
    that change the treatment effect by a given size.  In principle, Imbens'
    (2003) sensitivity analysis presents the contour of an equal bias having
    <b>alpha</b> in the horizontal axis and <b>delta</b> in the vertical axis.
<p>
    -<b>isa</b>- automatically maximizes the likelihood function developed by Imbens
    (2003), find such pairs with an efficient algorithm, and draw a contour
    by connecting these pairs.  How to interpret the resulting figure is
    explained below in <b><u>Example</u></b><b>.</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
        +-------+
    ----+ Model +------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>tau(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specifies the target size of the coefficient of the treatment
        variable.  For example, if a researcher finds the treatment effect of
        1.7 and wants to know the strength of the confounding by an
        unobservable that halves the coefficient, s/he should set <b>tau(</b><i>0</i>.<i>85</i><b>)</b>.
        The contour in the figure represents the set of partial effects of an
        unobservable that changes the coefficient to 0.85.
<p>
    <b>observation(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> specifies the number of points at which the value of
        <b>alpha</b> in the horizontal axis is fixed.  The values of alpha are
        automatically selected based on the number of <b>observation</b> and the
        range of <b>alpha</b>.  In the 2nd run, the roles of <b>alpha</b> and <b>delta</b> are
        switched.  In general, a larger value of <b>observation(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> results in
        a better figure at the cost of computation time.
<p>
    <b>resolution(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> specifies the number of iterations in finding the value
        of <b>delta</b> for each fized value of <b>alpha</b>. The algorithm searches <b>delta</b>
        by splitting the range of <b>delta</b> into half in each iteration.  Thus,
        the resolution specifies how fine estimate about <b>delta</b> a researcher
        wants to obtain.  For example, when the range of <b>delta</b> is [0,8],
        <b>resolution(</b><i>1</i><b>)</b> only tells us whether the value of <b>delta</b> lies in [0,4)
        or [4,8] while <b>resolution(</b><i>3</i><b>)</b> provides the value of <b>delta</b> at one-unit
        precision, say [3,4) or [4,5].  Default is<b> resolution(20)</b>.  In the
        2nd run, the roles of <b>alpha</b> and <b>delta</b> are switched.  In general, a
        larger value of <b>resolution(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> results in a more accurate figure at
        the cost of computation time.
<p>
    <b>minalpha(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> and <b>maxalpha(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specify the range of <b>alpha</b> within which
        the values of <b>alpha</b> are searched.  In Imbens (2003), <b>alpha</b> denotes
        the coefficient of unobservable in the treatment assignment equation
        and is represented by the horizontal axis.  In the first run, -<b>isa</b>-
        fixes the value of <b>alpha</b> at <b>observation(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> different points and,
        for each value of alpha, finds <b>delta</b> that changes the treatment
        effect to a given amount by changing its value.  In the second run,
        <b>alpha</b> plays the same role as <b>delta</b> in the first run.
<p>
    <b>mindelta(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> and <b>maxdelta(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specify the range of <b>delta</b> within which
        the values of <b>delta</b> are searched.  In Imbens (2003), <b>delta</b> denotes
        the coefficient of unobservable in the outcome equation and is
        represented by the vertical axis.  In the first run, for each value
        of alpha, -<b>isa</b>- finds <b>delta</b> that changes the treatment effect to a
        given amount by changing its value.  The value of <b>delta</b> is searched
        until the range of <b>delta</b> is halved by <b>resolution(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> times, or the
        updated treatment effect is close enough to the target value.  In the
        second run, <b>alpha</b> plays the same role as <b>delta</b> in the first run.

    ----+ SE/Robust +--------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>vce(</b><i>vcetype</i><b>)</b> "specifies the type of standard error reported, which
        includes types that are derived from asymptotic theory, that are
        robust to some kinds of misspecification that allow for intragroup
        correlation; see <b>[R] vce_option</b>." (*cited from Stata manual.)
<p>
<p>
        +----------+
    ----+ Advanced +---------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    <b>precision(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specifies the percentage error from <b>tau(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> at which
        iteration ends.  The default is<b> precision(0.1)</b>, which means that when
        a researcher sets <b>tau(</b>.<i>314</i><b>)</b>, for each fixed value of alpha(1st run)
        and delta(2nd run), -<b>isa</b>- stop iteration and move to the next value
        if the t-statistics of the treatment effect take any value between
        .313686(99.9% of .314) and .314314(100.1% of .314).  There is a trade
        off between computational time and accuracy, but the default value
        should be sufficiently small.
<p>
    <b>sminalpha(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> and <b>smaxalpha(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specify the range of <b>alpha</b> within
        which the values of <b>alpha</b> are searched in the second run.  In the
        second run, for each value of delta, -<b>isa</b>- finds <b>alpha</b> that changes
        the treatment effect to a given amount by changing its value.  The
        value of <b>alpha</b> is searched until the range of <b>alpha</b> is halved by
        <b>resolution(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b> times, or the updated treatment effect is close
        enough to the target value.  Researchers may set these options if
        they want to narrow down the range of <b>alpha</b> in the second run.
<p>
    <b>smindelta(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> and <b>smaxdelta(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specify the range of <b>delta</b> within
        which the values of <b>delta</b> are searched in the second run.  In the
        second run, -<b>isa</b>- fixes the value of <b>delta</b> at <b>observation(</b><i>int</i><b>)</b>
        different points and, for each value of delta, finds <b>alpha</b> that
        changes the treatment effect to a given amount by changing its value.
        Researchers may set these options if they want to increase the range
        of <b>delta</b> in the second run because needed to set the narrow range for
        <b>delta</b> in the 1st run.
<p>
    <b>skiprangecheck</b> skips the range check of initial values of minalpha,
        minalpha, minalpha and minalpha.  This option should be specified if
        researchers are certain about their specification of the initial
        values.  (e.g., when researchers ran -<b>isa_search</b>- before running
        -<b>isa</b>-.)
<p>
    <b>showrangecheck</b> shows the results of the range check performed in Step 2.
        This option helps users figure out how much change in <b>alpha</b> or <b>delta</b>
        is necessary for the program to pass the range check.  If the dataset
        is small or highly unbalanced, -<b>isa_search</b>- is better option to
        specify the values of <b>alpha</b> and <b>delta</b>.
<p>
    <b>quick</b> directs -<b> isa</b>- to move to the next step when the contour plots are
        more likely to be found if it switches the role of <b>alpha</b> and <b>delta</b>.
        Specifically, -<b>isa</b>- moves to the next step if it cannot find <b>delta</b>
        smaller than 75% of the target value for a given fixed <b>alpha</b> or
        <b>delta</b>.  For small, unbalanced data, it is possible, however, that
        this option mistakenly skips the rest of iterations due to the
        finding of irrelevant contour.
<p>
    <b>tstat(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> specifies the target size of the t-statistics of the
        treatment variable.  Because the standard errors produced by -isa-
        are not accurate, the users should use -gsa- if they want to draw the
        bound in terms of test statistics.  See Harada (2012) for the detail.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Example</u></b>
<p>
    The example below evaluates the effect of union membership on hourly wage
    assuming that union membership is a treatment variable.
<p>
    . sysuse nlsw88
    . xi i.race
    . rename _Irace_2 black
    . rename _Irace_3 other
    . xi i.industry
    . rename _Iindustry_5 mnfctr
    . isa wage union grade mnfctr south black age other married c_city,
        tau(.314)
<p>
    If covariates in the model capture all factors that affect the wage and
    the likelihood of becoming a union member, the treatment effect is
    unbiased.  However, researchers might be worry about the possibility that
    some unobserved individual predispositions affect the decision of
    becoming a union membership and the wage.  In the original model, union
    membership increases the hourly wage by .628 , so I set <b>tau(</b>.<i>314</i><b>)</b>, which
    reduces the treatment effect into half.
<p>
    In 10 minutes or so, -<b>isa</b>- produces the figure with a convex contour and
    several plots below the contour.  This contour indicates the statistical
    power that an unobservable needs to have for the treatment effect to
    become half.  For example, an unobservable needs to have the partial
    R-squares of 0.025 in the outcome equation and 0.1 in the treatment
    assignment equation to halve the treatment effect.  Several plots provide
    further information about the strength of this assumption.  These plots
    represent the partial R-squares when each of them is omitted from the
    models.  In other words, these plots show the statistical power of each
    covariate.
<p>
    For instance, the plots of <b>grade</b> (years of education) and <b>mnfctr</b>
    (manufacturing sector job) are located near the contour.  This indicates
    that if there is an unobservable of which effects on the outcome variable
    and the treatment variable are as strong as the effects of <b>grade</b> and
    <b>mnfctr</b>, the treatment would become half.  Whether this assumption is
    strong or weak depends on researchers substantive knowledge.  For
    example, if a researcher believes that an unobservable that is comparable
    to education is unlikely to exist, the treatment effect of union
    membership would be fairly robust to against unobserved confounders.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Tips</u></b>
<p>
    1. Do not set <b>maxalpha</b> and <b>maxdelta</b> too large.  This increases the
    probability that -<b>isa</b>- finds the irrelevant contour, which messes up the
    algorithm.  Default values often specify the reasonable range.
<p>
    2. If -<b>isa</b>- produces oddly-shaped, too-short, or no contour, try
    -<b>isa_search</b>-.  If a contour is almost OK but you want a better contour,
    you may only need to adjust some options such as <b>observation</b>, <b>resolution</b>,
    <b>minalpha</b>, <b>maxalpha</b>, <b>mindelta</b>, and <b>maxdelta</b>.
<p>
    3. After -<b>isa_search</b>-, if setting <b>minalpha</b>, <b>maxalpha</b>, <b>mindelta</b>, and
    <b>maxdelta</b> according to the result of -<b>isa_search</b>- still does not produce a
    good contour, set <b>sminalpha</b>, <b>smaxalpha</b>, <b>smindelta</b>, and <b>smaxdelta</b>.
    However, this does not necessarily mean that setting these options always
    increases the probability of producing a good contour.  Therefore, try
    both with and without these options.
<p>
    4. You can manually drop problematic observations that produce the
    irrelevant contour(s) and reproduce the contour using -<b>isa_graph</b>-.
<p>
    5. Without setting <b>sminalpha</b>, <b>smaxalpha</b>, <b>smindelta</b>, and <b>smaxdelta</b>, the
    options "<b>skip</b> <b>obs(</b><i>200</i><b>)</b>" may help produce a contour.  In this case, you
    probably need to drop some problematic results manually.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Saved results</u></b>

    these saved variables.  The results of<i> _n</i> th iteration are recorded in
