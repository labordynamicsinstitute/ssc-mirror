<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>indeplist</b> -- Returns lists of independent variables from the active
                   estimation command.
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>indeplist</b> [<b>,</b> <b><u>eq</u></b><b>uation(</b><i>equation list</i><b>)</b> <b><u>lo</u></b><b>cal</b> <b><u>cons</u></b><b>tant</b> <b><u>drop</u></b><b>ped</b>]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>indeplist</b> displays the names of the independent variables of the active
    estimation command. Separate list will be displayed if the estimation
    command contains multiple equations, unless the <b>equation</b> option is
    specified. In that case only lists of independent variables from the
    equations specified in the <b>equation</b> option will be displayed.  By default
    the constant and all variables that were droped by Stata (due to
    multicolinearity) are not included in the list. This default can be
    overturned by specifying the the <b>constant</b> and/or the <b>dropped</b> option
    respectively.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b><u>eq</u></b><b>uation(</b><i>equation list</i><b>)</b> Specifies the equations from which the
        independent variables will be displayed. The equation name needs to
        be enclosed by quotation marks if the equation name contains spaces.
<p>
    <b><u>lo</u></b><b>cal</b> Specifies that the lists of independent variables are stored in
        locals within the calling program's space. The locals are caled
        X<i>eqname</i>, where <i>eqname</i> is the name of the equation with the spaces
        removed. <b>indeplist</b> will now also make a local called <i>locnames</i> that
        contains the names of the locals made by <b>indeplist</b>, except the local
        <i>locnames</i> itself. This option is primarily useful in combination with 
        <b>foreach</b>.
<p>
    <b><u>cons</u></b><b>tant</b> Specifies that the constant is also treated as an independent
        variable and returned in the lists of independent variables. If this
        option is not specified the constant (_cons) will be removed from the
        lists of independent variables.
<p>
    <b><u>drop</u></b><b>ped</b> Specifies that all variables that were dropped by Stata due to
        multicolinearity are still included in the list of variables.
<p>
<b><u>Saved results</u></b>
<p>
    <b>r(X</b><i>eqname</i><b>)</b> Contains the list of independent variables for equation
        <i>eqname</i>. Spaces are removed from <i>eqname</i> if the equation name constains
        spaces.
