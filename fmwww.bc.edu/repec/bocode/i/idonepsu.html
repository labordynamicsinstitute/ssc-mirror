Utility for dealing with strata that have singleton PSUs
-------------------------
<p>
<p>
     ^idonepsu^ [varlist][^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [, Strata(varname)
                        Psu(varname) Generate(newvarname) SWitch]
<p>
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^idonepsu^ identifies strata that have only one PSU and, optionally,
merges them into the largest strata.  This command should be used 
with caution as the appropriate merge of strata depends on the
sample design.  This utility is intended for persons doing large
secondary data analysis where they are uncertain of the sampling
strategy and are, therefore, unable to identify the appropriate
strata in which to merge.  The merge is done in accord with
the method suggested by the STATA 7 manual.

Options
-------
^varlist^ identifies the variables that are being used in the command
that produces the singleton PSU warning.  ^idonepsu^ uses the ^varlist^
only to identify missing values in variables and thus exclude the 
observation from the determination of singleton PSUs
<p>
^strata^ identifies the variable containing the strata.  If no variable
is specified, the variable that is currently set as the strata is used.
For more information, see ^svyset^.
<p>
^psu^ identifies the variable containing the PSU.  If no variable is
specified, the variable that is currently set as the PSU is used.  For
more information, see ^svyset^.
<p>
^generate^ takes the strata with singleton PSU identified and then merges
them into the strata with the most observations and renames the PSU to
be unique within the merged strata.  This is not the rigorous
approach to dealing with singleton PSU, but it allows any inaccuracies to
be absorbed by the strata with the most observations.  The newly formed
strata variable with the merged strata variable is put into ^newvarname^str.
The identities of the strata that were merged and the strata into which 
They were merged are identified in the notes.  Type -notes ^newvarname^str-
The PSUs of the merged variable are also recoded to be unique and are placed
In the new PSU, named ^newvarname^psu.  The changes in PSU are identified in
The notes for ^newvarname^psu.  Type -notes ^newvarnam^psu-  
<p>
^switch^  To run analyses, you will need to switch your psu and strata to the 
new psu and strata.  Using the ^switch^ option merely automates this by
issuing the commands -svyset strata ^newvarname^str- and the corresponding
-svyset psu ^newvarname^psu-.  
<p>
Example
-------
<p>
If you want to know what strata have only one psu with the current settings:
<p>
        idonepsu
<p>
If you would like to merge strata with singleton PSUs into the 
largest strata and call the new strata variable fixemstr and the 
new PSU variable fixempsu:
<p>
        idonepsu, generate(fixem)
<p>
If you want to know what strata have only one psu with restrictions:
<p>
        idonepsu depvar indvar1 indvar2 if smart==1, strata(str) psu(psuu)
<p>
If you would like to merge strata with singleton PSUs based on the 
restrictions into the largest strata and call the new strata variable slickstr
and the new PSU variable slickpsu:
<p>
        idonepsu depvar indvar1 indvar2 if smart==1, 
                        strata(str) psu(psuu) generate(slick)
<p>
If you would like to do the same as the above, but have the default
psu and strata switched to the newly created psu and strata, simply
type the ^switch^ option:
<p>
        idonepsu depvar indvar1 indvar2 if smart==1, 
                        strata(str) psu(psuu) generate(slick) switch
