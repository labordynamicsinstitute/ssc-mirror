<b><u>Filter names into variable names and others</u></b>
<p>
        <b>isvar</b> <i>possiblevarlist</i>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>isvar</b> takes a list of names that might name variables in your dataset and
    filters it into a list of those names that are indeed variable names and
    a list of the others.
<p>
    One application of <b>isvar</b> arises when you are moving between similar
    datasets, especially if they are large, but are not sure which variables
    are defined in which dataset. Commands such as describe would fail at the
    first name not in fact a variable name. <b>isvar</b> offers a more direct way to
    establish existence or non-existence of several possible variables.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Saved results</u></b> 
<p>
    r(varlist) names of variables in current dataset
    r(badlist) names that do not correspond to variables in current dataset
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    <b>. isvar mpg rep78 rep77</b>
    <b>. local OKlist "`r(varlist)'"</b>
    <b>. su `OKlist'</b>
