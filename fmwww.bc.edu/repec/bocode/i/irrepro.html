Irreproducible results

Description
-----------
<p>
Imagine an urn containing w white and b black balls, together with
inexhaustible supplies of white and black balls. Pick one ball from the
urn randomly, and replace it in the urn, together with a additional
balls of the same colour. Repeat indefinitely. What happens to (say) the
proportion of white balls in the urn?
<p>
Experiment indicates, and analysis confirms, that in any particular
experiment the proportion stabilises rapidly, but on an unrepeatable
value. A set of experiments approximates a distribution of limiting
proportions that is beta over the whole range from 0 to 1 (uniform if b
= w = a = 1). In effect, early choices are crucial, even though each
history looks increasingly flat.
<p>
^irrepro^ runs the experiment once and plots proportion white against
number of picks.
<p>
^irrepron^ (think: ^irrepro^ run ^n^ times) runs the experiment for as
many times as there are observations. Under Windows, the effect is a
movie with as many frames as there are observations.
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
If there are no data in memory, ^irrepro^ sets the number of
observations to 200. This is suggested as a suitable number.
<p>
The user must have installed ^distplot^ previously.
<p>
This model was discussed by Eggenberger and P\'olya (1923). Cohen (1976)
and May (1976) give accessible discussions of the model and its
interpretation.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^black(^#^)^ specifies the number of black balls (default 1).
<p>
^white(^#^)^ specifies the number of white balls (default 1).
<p>
^add(^#^)^ specifies the number of balls to be added (default 1).
<p>
^connect(^ ^)^ can be used to suppress connection of data points. The
    default is ^l^.
<p>
^symbol(^ ^)^ can be used to specify a plotting symbol. The default
    is ^.^ (dot).
<p>
^generate(^newvar^)^ can be used to save the results of n experiments
    each producing a proportion white after n picks.
<p>
graph_options refers to options of ^graph, twoway^ other than ^xla( )^
    ^yla( ) gap( ) t1( )^.
