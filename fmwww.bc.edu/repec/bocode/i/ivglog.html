^fweight^s, ^iweight^s, ^aweight^s, and ^pweight^s are allowed; see help

<p>
^ivglog^ shares the features of all estimation commands; see help @est@.
<p>
<p>
The syntax of @predict@ following ^ivglog^ is
<p>
        ^predict^ [type] newvarname [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] [^,^ statistic]
<p>
where statistic is
<p>
        ^n^               predicted values of depvar
        ^xb^              linear prediction
        ^stdp^            standard error of the linear prediction
<p>
These statistics are available both in and out of sample; type "^predict^ ...
^if e(sample)^ ..." if wanted only for the estimation sample.

Description
------------
<p>
^ivglog^ estimates a full-information maximum-likelihood version of the
inverse Gaussian family-log link generalized linear model.  That is, the
coefficient (i.e., point) estimates produced by ^ivglog^ are similar to the
coefficient estimates produced by ^glm^ ...^, family(ig) link(log)^; see
help @glm@.  The standard errors, however, will be slightly different since
the log link is not the canonical link for the inverse Gaussian family.
<p>
^ivglog^ estimates distributions with a typically high initial peak with
a long tail. It can be used to estimate otherwise log-gamma of negative
binomial models with extremely long right-hand tails; see help @gammalog@
and help @nbreg@.
<p>
The outcome variable assumed for ^ivglog^ is continuous and is strictly
greater than zero.  (^ivglog^ does not allow depvar to take on the value zero
or any negative value.)

Options

^irr^ and ^eform^ both do the same thing.  They report estimated coefficients
    transformed to incidence-rate ratios.
      
^robust^ specifies the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance is to be 
used
    in place of the traditional calculation; see ^[U] 23.11 Obtaining robust^
    ^variance estimates^.  ^robust^ combined with ^cluster()^ allows 
observations
    which are not independent within cluster (although they be be independent
    between clusters).  If you specify ^pweight^s, ^robust^ is implied.
<p>
^cluster(^varname^)^ specifies that the observations are independent across 
groups
    (clusters) but not necessarily within groups.  varname specifies to which
    group each observation belongs; e.g., ^cluster(personid)^ in data with
    repeated observations on individuals.  See ^[U] 23.11 Obtaining robust^
    ^variance estimates^.  ^cluster()^ can be used with @pweight@s to produce 
esti-
    mates for unstratified cluster-sampled data.  Specifying ^cluster()^ 
implies
    ^robust^.
<p>
^score(^newvars^)^ creates newvar containing each observation's contribution 
to the
    score; see ^[U] 23.12 Obtaining scores^.  If two new varnames are 
specified,
    then the score from the ancillary parameter equation is also saved.
<p>
^level(^#^)^ specifies the confidence level, in percent, for confidence 
intervals;
    see help @level@.
<p>
maximize_options control the maximization process; see help @maximize@.  You
    should never have to specify them.
<p>
<p>
Options for ^predict^
--------------------
<p>
^n^, calculates the predicted value of depvar, exp(x_j*b)
<p>
^xb^ calculates the linear prediction.
<p>
^stdp^ calculates the standard error of the linear prediction.
<p>
