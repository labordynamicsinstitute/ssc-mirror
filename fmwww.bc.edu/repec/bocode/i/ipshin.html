<b>ipshin</b> is for use with panel data.  You must <b>tsset</b> your data before using
<b>ipshin</b>, using the panel form of <b>tsset</b>; see help tsset.
<p>
<i>varname</i> may contain time-series operators; see help varlist.
<p>
Users of Stata 11+ should use the official <b>xtunitroot ips</b> command.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
 
<b>ipshin</b> estimates the t-test for unit roots in heterogeneous panels developed by
Im, Pesaran and Shin (IPS, 2003).  It allows for individual effects, time
trends, and common time effects.  Based on the mean of the individual
Dickey-Fuller t-statistics of each unit in the panel, the IPS test assumes that
all series are non-stationary under the null hypothesis. Lags of the dependent
variable may be introduced to allow for serial correlation in the errors.  The
exact critical values of the t-bar statistic are given in IPS. After
transformation by factors provided in the paper, the W[t-bar] statistic (4.10)
is distributed standard normal under the null hypothesis of nonstationarity.
(Note that in the working paper version, this statistic was known as Psi-bar
(5.3)). The tables in the paper limit the calculation of this statistic to a
maximum of 8 lags in any series.
<p>
 
Unlike the Levin and Lin (1993) test, which assumes that all series are
stationary under the alternative, IPS is consistent under the alternative that
only a fraction of the series are stationary.

<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>lags</b> must be specified, and may take on any non-negative value. If a single
    value is provided, that lag length is used for all individuals. If a list
    of lags is provided (perhaps with a local macro), its length must match the
    number of individuals in the panel.
<p>
<b>trend</b> includes a time trend in the estimated equation.
<p>
<b>nodemean</b> omits the elimination of common time effects.
