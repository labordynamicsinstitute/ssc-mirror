<b><u>Title</u></b>
<p>
    <b>iciss</b> -- ICD-9 based Injury Severity Score
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Version</u></b>
<p>
    Version 3.0.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  ICDPIC Version 3.0 has
    been tested in STATA 10 and STATA 11, but the authors believe it should
    also work without incident in STATA 8 and STATA 9.  If you have any
    problems using ICDPIC Version 3.0 in STATA 8 or STATA 9, please inform
    the authors.
<p>
    ICDPIC Version 3.0 may be installed from within STATA using the <b>ssc</b>
    command.  If you installed a previous version of ICDPIC from the SSC
    archives website using the <b>ssc</b> command, we suggest that you first delete
    it by typing <b>ssc uninstall icdpic</b> followed by <b>ssc install icdpic</b>.
    Alternatively, you may use <b>ssc install icdpic, replace</b>.  See help for 
    ssc.
<p>
    If you installed any previous ICDPIC files obtained directly from the
    authors, please delete them <b>ALL</b> (.ado, .hlp and .dta files) to avoid any
    conflicts with ICDPIC 3.0 files.
<p>
    Please enter complete variable names in the ICDPIC Version 3.0 dialog
    boxes.  Do not use abbreviations.
<p>
    New to Version 3.0 is the addition of a dialog box (.dlg) file associated
    with each individual ICDPIC Version 3.0 program (.ado) file.  To access
    the ICDPIC dialog box, and all the ICDPIC programs, type: <b>db icdpic</b>.
    Typing <b>icdpic</b>, as in earlier versions, will still work, but <b>ONLY</b> with
    <b>icdpic</b>.  For example, to access the ICISS program directly, type: <b>db</b>
    <b>iciss</b>.  Typing <b>iciss</b>, as in previous versions, will produce an error.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to use path\file names
    containing spaces.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to run in STATA 11.0.
<p>
    Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is a bug that caused the <b>triss</b> program to
    crash if the <i>rts</i> variable was named anything other than "rts".
<p>
    New in ICDPIC Version 3.0 (<b>trauma</b> program only) is the ability to choose
    whether an AIS value of 6 automatically forces an ISS of 75 or to
    automatically have all AIS values of 6 changed to an AIS value of 5 and
    then have the ISS calculated normally.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have memory.  Each time a dialog
    box is opened within the same STATA session, it will remember the values
    last entered.
<p>
    All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have the following buttons:
<p>
      <i>OK</i> executes the program and removes the dialog box from the screen.
<p>
      <i>SUBMIT</i> executes the program and leaves the dialog box on the screen.
             Note that if an error message is generated the dialog box may be
             minimized.
<p>
      <i>CANCEL</i> removes the dialog box from the screen and does nothing.
             Clicking on the close icon of the dialog box does the same
             thing.
<p>
      <i>HELP</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and presents the program help
           file.  The <i>HELP</i> button has a question mark on it.
<p>
      <i>COPY</i> leaves the dialog box on the screen and copies the program command
           to the clipboard.
<p>
      <i>RESET</i> resets the values of the controls in the dialog box to their
            initial state, just as if the dialog box were invoked for the
            first time.  Each time a user invokes a dialog box, its controls
            will be filled in with the values the user last entered.  <i>RESET</i>
            restores the control values to their defaults.  The <i>RESET</i> button
            has an R on it.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Syntax</u></b>
<p>
        <b>db iciss</b>

<p>
        <b>db icdpic</b>
<p>

    The <i>ICISS</i> dialog box will open.  Follow the instructions.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>iciss</b> calculates ICISS using both survival risk ratios (SRR's) and
    independent survival risk ratios (SRRi's).
<p>
<p>
                        ICISS= (SRR_1)(SRR_2)...(SRR_N)
<p>
                                      <b>OR</b>
<p>
                      ICISS = (SRRi_1)(SRRi_2)...(SRRi_N)
<p>
<p>
    where ICISS for SRR is defined as the product of all survival risk ratios
    (SRR's) for an individual patient's ICD-9-CM injury diagnosis codes
    (N-Codes).  Similarly, ICISS for SRRi is defined as the product of all
    independent survival risk ratios (SRRi's) for an individual patient's
    N-Codes.  See help for srr for more infomation on SRR's and SRRi's.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    None
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
    The user should first run <b>srr</b> or <b>icdpic</b> on his/her data to produce the
    necessary table of SRR and SRRi values.  See help for srr.
<p>
    The user's data must contain ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes.  Diagnosis codes
    in the user's data must be of type string.  A decimal point in the
    diagnosis codes is optional.  Diagnosis codes should have a width of 5 (6
    if a decimal point is present).  The diagnosis code prefix must be the
    same for all diagnosis codes and numbered sequentially starting with 1,
    for example, dx1...dxN.
<p>
    <b>srr</b> adds the following variables to a new copy of the user's data stored
    on disk:
<p>
<p>
        <i>srr_1-srr_n</i>: survival risk ratio for ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 1..n
        <i>srri_1-srri_n</i>: independent survival risk ratio for ICD-9-CM diagnosis
            codes 1..n
        <i>srrprod</i>: ICISS (product of srr values for all N-Codes)
        <i>srriprod</i>: ICISS (product of srri values for all N-Codes)
        <i>min_srr</i>: minimum srr value amongst all N-Codes
        <i>min_srri</i>: minimum srri value amongst all N-Codes
        <i>srr_cnt</i>: number of srr values that were involved in computation of
            srrprod
        <i>srri_cnt</i>: number of srri values that were involved in computation of
            srriprod
<p>
   
    <i>srr</i> and <i>srri</i> variables for diagnosis codes that are not valid N-Codes
    will have missing values.  If there are no valid N-Codes, variables
    <i>srrprod</i>, <i>srriprod</i>, <i>min_srr</i> and <i>min_srri</i> will be missing and variables
    <i>srr_cnt</i> and <i>srri_cnt</i> will be 0.  If there are no valid N-Codes with an
    SRR, variables for <i>srrprod</i> and <i>min_srr</i> will have missing values and
    variable <i>srr_cnt</i> will be 0.  If there are no valid N-Codes with an SRRi,
    variables for <i>srriprod</i> and <i>min_srri</i> will have missing values and variable
    <i>srri_cnt</i> will be 0.
<p>
    <i>srr</i> and <i>srri</i> variables and variables <i>srrprod</i>, <i>srriprod</i>, <i>min_srr</i> and
    <i>min_srri</i> are rounded to the nearest 0.0001.  If any of these values are
    equal, or round to, 0.0000 or 1.0000 they are replaced with 0.0001 and
    0.9999 respectively.
