<b><u>Perform Ramsey/Pesaran-Taylor/Pagan-Hall RESET specification test after IV/GMM/</u></b>

<p>
<b>ivreset</b> is for use after ivreg2 and regress.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>ivreset</b> performs various flavors of Ramsey's regression error specification
test (RESET) as adapted by Pesaran and Taylor (1999) and Pagan and Hall (1983)
for instrumental variables (IV) estimation.  The RESET test is sometimes called
an "omitted variables test" but probably is best interpreted as a test of
neglected nonlinearities in the choice of functional form (Wooldridge 2002, pp.
124-5).  Under the null that there are no neglected nonlinearities, the
residuals should be uncorrelated with low-order polynomials in y-hat, where the
y-hats are the "forecast values" of the dependent variable (see below).  The
test flavors vary according to the polynomial terms (square, cube, 4th power of
y-hat), the choice of forecast values (Pesaran-Taylor optimal forecasts or
Pagan-Hall reduced form forecasts), test statistic (Wald or GMM-distance), and
large vs. small sample statistic (chi-squared or F-statistic).  The test
statistic is distributed with degrees of freedom = number of polynomial terms.
The default is the Pesaran-Taylor version using the square of the optimal
forecast of y and a chi-squared Wald statistic with one degree of freedom.
<p>
If the original <b>ivreg2</b> or <b>regress</b> estimation was heteroskedastic-robust,
cluster-robust, autocorrelation-consistent (AC), or heteroskedastic and
autocorrelation-consistent (HAC), the RESET test reported will be as well.
<p>
<b>ivreset</b> can also be used after OLS or HOLS regression with <b>regress</b> or <b>ivreg2</b>,
when there are no endogenous regressors.  In this case, a standard Ramsey RESET
test using fitted values of y is reported.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b><u>rf</u></b><b>orm</b> requests the Pagan-Hall (1983) version of the RESET test for IV
    regression instead of the default Pesaran-Taylor (1999) version.  The
    Pagan-Hall version uses the reduced form forecast y-hat of the dependent
    variable y, as opposed to the default Pesaran-Taylor version that uses an
    "optimal forecast" (see below).
<p>
<b><u>poly</u></b><b>nomial(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> requests a second, third, or fourth-order polynomial in y-hat.
    The default is a second-order polynomial, i.e., y-hat squared.
<p>
<b>cstat</b> requests a C-test statistic, also known as a "GMM-distance" or
    "difference-in-Sargan" test statistic (see below), instead of the default
    Wald statistic.
<p>
<b>small</b> requests a small-sample F statistic instead of the default chi-squared
    statistic.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
The Ramsey (1969) RESET test is a standard test of neglected nonlinearities in
the choice of functional form (sometimes, perhaps misleadingly, also described
as a test for omitted variables; see ovtest and Wooldridge (2002), pp. 124-5).
The principle is to estimate y=X*beta+W*gamma+u and then test the significance
of gamma.  The Ws in a RESET test can either be powers of X or, as implemented
here, powers of the forecast values of y.
<p>
As Pagan and Hall (1983) and Pesaran and Taylor (1999) point out, a RESET test
for an IV regression cannot use the standard IV predicted values X*beta-hat,
because X includes endogenous regressors that are correlated with u.  Instead,
the RESET test needs to be implemented using "forecast values" of y that are
functions of the instruments (exogenous variables) only.
<p>
Denote the full set of instruments by Z (possibly including exogenous
regressors also in X).
<p>
In the Pagan-Hall version of the test, the forecast values y-hat are the
reduced form predicted values of y, i.e., the predicted values Z*pi-hat from a
regression of y on the instruments Z.
<p>
In the Pesaran-Taylor version of the test, the forecast values y-hat are the
"optimal forecast" values.  The optimal forecast (predictor) y-hat is defined
as X-hat*beta-hat, where beta-hat is the IV estimate of the coefficents and
X-hat consists of the exogenous regressors in X and the reduced form predicted
values of the endogenous regressors in X.  The latter are the predicted values
Z*pi-hat from regressions of the endogenous Xs on the instruments Z.  Note that
if the equation is exactly identified, the optimal forecasts and reduced form
forecasts coincide, and the Pesaran-Taylor and Pagan-Hall tests are identical.
<p>
In both the Pesaran-Taylor and Pagan-Hall versions of the RESET test, the
augmented equation is y=X*beta+W*gamma+u, where the Ws are the powers of y-hat.
The default is squares of y-hat, but 3rd and 4th powers of y-hat can be
requested.  This equation is estimated by IV, and the default test statistic is
a Wald test of the significance of gamma.  Under the null that there are no
neglected nonlinearities and the equation is otherwise well-specified, the test
statistic is distributed as chi-squared with degrees of freedom equal to the
number of powers of y-hat.
<p>
Alternatively, Godfrey has suggested that a C-test statistic (also known as a
"GMM-distance" or "difference-in-Sargan" test) be used to test whether the
powers of y-hat can be added to the orthogonality or moment conditions that
define the IV or OLS estimator (see Pesaran and Taylor, pp. 262-63).  This test
can be requested with the <b>cstat</b> option.  Under the null that the equation is
well-specified and has no neglected nonlinearities, J-J1 is distributed as
chi-squared with degrees of freedom equal to the number of powers of y-hat,
where J1 is the Sargan-Hansen statistic for the original IV estimation and J is
the Sargan-Hansen statistic for the IV estimation using the additional
orthogonality conditions provided by the powers of y-hat.  For a general
discussion of this test, see help ivreg2 (if installed) and Hayashi (2000), pp.
218-22 and pp. 232-34.
<p>
If the equation was estimated using OLS or HOLS (heteroskedastic OLS - see help
ivreg2), and there there are no endogenous regressors, <b>ivreset</b> reports a
standard Ramsey RESET test using the fitted values of y, i.e., X*beta-hat.
Note that if the original estimation was OLS or HOLS, the excluded instruments
(if any) are ignored by <b>ivreset</b>.
<p>
If the original equation was estimated using <b>robust</b>, <b>cluster</b>, or <b>bw</b>, so is the
augmented equation, and the RESET test statistic will be heteroskedastic-,
cluster-, and/or autocorrelation-robust, respectively.
