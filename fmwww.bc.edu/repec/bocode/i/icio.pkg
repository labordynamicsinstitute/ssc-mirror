d 'ICIO': module for Economic Analysis with Inter-Country Input-Output tables
d
d  Several new statistical tools and analytical frameworks have
d been recently developed to measure countries' and sectors'
d involvement in global value chains. Such a wealth of
d methodologies reflects the fact that different empirical
d questions call for distinct accounting methods and different
d levels of aggregation of trade flows. In this article, we
d describe icio, a new command for the computation of the most
d appropriate measures of trade in value added as well as
d participation in global value chains. icio follows the conceptual
d framework proposed by Borin and Mancini (2019, Policy Research
d Working Paper WPS 8804; WDR 2020 Background Paper, World Bank
d Group), which in turn extends, refines, and reconciles the other
d main contributions in this strand of the literature. icio is
d flexible enough to work with any intercountry inputâ€“output
d table and with any level of aggregation of trade flows.
