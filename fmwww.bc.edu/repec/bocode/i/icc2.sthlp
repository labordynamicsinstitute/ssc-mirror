{title:Description}

{pstd}Textbooks often calculate the ICC using sums of squares on a 
subject-by-measurement matrix with non-missing cells.

{pstd}The idea of the ICC is to compare the wanted variation explained by a 
factor variable on an outcome with the total variation, the total variation 
being the wanted variation by the factor variable plus the unwanted variation.{break}
Bias occurs sometimes from the measurement repetitions.

{pstd}The ANOVA-like calculations ignore all measurements by a subject if just 
one measurement for that subject is missing and may also return ICC estimates 
below zero.{break}
The latter is theoretically impossible.

{pstd}To better utilize subjects with missing measurements and avoid obtaining 
negative ICCs, it is better to use estimates from a mixed, crossed regression.

{pstd}The command -icc2- returns a matrix with the absolute and consistency ICCs 
with a 95% confidence interval and a P-value for the ICCs equal to zero.{break}
The user can obtain more precise confidence intervals using the bootstrap.
