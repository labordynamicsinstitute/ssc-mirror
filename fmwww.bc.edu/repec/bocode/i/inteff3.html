        <b>inteff3</b> is for use after a probit or logit model has been estimated.
                The model must include the three single dummies, all double
                interactions and the triple interaction term.
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
Norton et al. (2004) have derived the formulae for partial effects of
interaction terms of two variables in logit and probit models, implemented in
the module inteff.
<p>
In the same logic, <b>inteff3</b> computes partial effects in a probit or logit model
with a triple dummy variable interaction term.  The default is to compute the
partial effects at means.
<p>
The model may be applied when the effect of a binary regressor on a binary
dependent variable is allowed to vary over combinations of two sub-groups.  For
example, one may be interested in the way a university degree and the presence
of children affect the gender difference in labour market participation. To
this effect, one may run a probit model of labour market participation
including dummies for female, university degree and presence of children, as
well as their pairwise and triple interaction terms.
<p>
A difference-in-difference-in-differences estimator with a binary dependent
variable (see for example Gruber and Poterba 1994) may also seem to be a
suitable application. However, Puhani (2008) argues that the treatment effect
in non-linear difference-in-differences models is not given by the interaction
effect à la Ai and Norton (2003). In fact, computing the interaction effect à
la Ai and Norton (2003) would not ensure that the difference-in-differences
treatment effect is bounded between 0 and 1.
<p>
See Cornelissen and Sonderhof (2009) for the formulae of the partial effects of
the interaction terms in the probit model with triple dummy variable
interactions. <b>inteff3</b> uses the delta method to compute the standard errors of
the partial effects and partly relies on the built-in Stata functions nlcom and
predictnl for this purpose.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
<p>
<b>varx1</b>() - <b>varx1x2x3</b>() can be used to specify the variable names of the the
                      three single dummies (x1, x2, x3), all double
                      interactions (x1*x2, x1*x3, x2*x3) and the triple
                      interaction term (x1*x2*x3). By default, inteff3 assumes
                      (and checks) that they are given by the first seven
                      regressors in the following order: x1 x2 x3 x1*x2 x1*x3
                      x2*x3 x1*x2*x3.
  
<b>average</b>               rather than computing the partial effect at certain
                      values (e.g. means), the effect is computed for each
                      observation and then averaged over all observations. The
                      default is to compute the partial effects at means.
<p>
<b>at</b>(numlist)           specifies that partial effects are to be computed at the
                      values passed in this option.  The first three values are
                      those for the three dummy variables followed by the
                      values for the control variables (excluding the double
                      and triple dummy interactions). The default is to compute
                      the partial effects at means.
<p>
<b>pex1</b>() - <b>pex1x2x3</b>()   specifiy names of new variables, in which the respective
                      partial effects are to be stored. These options <b>pex1</b>() -
                      <b>pex1x2x3</b>() have to be combined with the option average.
<p>
<b>sx1</b>() - <b>sx1x2x3</b>()     specifiy names of new variables, in which the standard
                      errors of the partial effects are to be stored. These
                      options <b>sx1</b>() - <b>sx1x2x3</b>() have to be combined with the
                      option average.
<p>
<b>post</b>                  When post is specified, <b>inteff3</b> will post the vector of
                      partial effects and the diagonal elements of the
                      variance-covariance matrix to e().  Important: <b>inteff3</b>
                      only computes the variances of the partial effects needed
                      for simple tests on the partial effects.  <b>inteff3</b> does
                      not compute the the covariances. The covariances are
                      posted in e(V) as <b>zero</b>, which are not the true
                      covariances!
                      The option <b>post</b> overwrites the saved estimates of the
                      preceding probit model, and inteff3 cannot be recalled
                      unless another probit model is estimated.
