<b><u>Install SSC routines needed for ITMEUS</u></b>
<p>
        <b>itmeus</b>
<p>
    <b>itmeus</b> is a convenience command that accompanies <i>An Introduction to Modern</i>
    <i>Econometrics Using Stata</i>, by Christopher F. Baum (Stata Press, 2006).  The
    book's examples use several unofficial user-written Stata commands that are
    available from the SSC archive. The <b>itmeus</b> command will automatically
    install the latest versions of these commands into the user's copy of Stata
    by using the official <b>ssc</b> command.
<p>
    You must have Stata 8.2 or later to use <b>itmeus</b> and these commands; some
    commands may require Stata version 9.  Stata 8.2 is a free upgrade from
    Stata 8.0 or 8.1; see <b>update query</b>.
<p>
    Many user-written routines are under development and are often updated for
    new features and bug fixes.  If you have Stata 9, you may use the official
    <b>adoupdate</b> command at any time to check whether you have the latest versions
    of all user-written commands installed from the SSC archive, the <i>Stata</i>
    <i>Journal</i> and <i>Stata Technical Bulletin</i>, and selected user sites. Therefore,
    if you run <b>itmeus</b> today, you might use <b>adoupdate</b> after 1 or 2 months to
    ensure that your copies of the installed routines are up to date.
