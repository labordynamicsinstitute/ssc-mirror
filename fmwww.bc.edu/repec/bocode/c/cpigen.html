<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>cpigen</b> uses that a numeric variable <b>year</b> on the current data, and a numeric
variable <b>quarter</b> or a numeric variable <b>month</b> if available, defining calendar
time in the usual way, to generate two variables <b>cpi</b> and <b>cpiu</b> containing
versions of the Consumer Price Index commonly used to convert US dollar amounts
to "real" dollars.  The first, <b>cpi</b> (supported range 1913-2006), is the research
series (applying more consistent methods over time) CPI-U-RS or CPI-U-X1 where
available, and an adjusted version of the CPI-U where no research series is
available, as is standard Census practice.  The second, <b>cpiu</b> (supported range
1913-2007), is the seasonally adjusted CPI-U, for all goods, for urban
consumers, also available from freduse CPIAUCSL.
<p>
The research series data for 1978 to 2006 comes from the BLS publication
http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiurs1978_2006.pdf updated at
http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiursai1978_2010.pdf. For more discussion of these
series, and other indices in the CPI family, see http://www.bls.gov/cpi and the
article by Kenneth J. Stewart and Stephen B. Reed, "CPI Research Series Using
Current Methods, 1978-98," in the Monthly Labor Review, June 1999, downloadable
at http://stats.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1999/06/cpimlr.pdf.  A useful basic
description is http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq5.htm.
<p>
Earlier data (monthly CPI-U data for 1913 through 1920) comes from
ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt.  Though undocumented,
this source matches the unadjusted CPI-U freduse data, which shows 174 for
December 2000, whereas the seasonally adjusted CPI-U is 174.6; the ratio of
December 2006 to December 1977 is 3.250 for unadjusted and 3.255 for seasonally
adjusted CPI-U, whereas that ratio is 2.96 for the research series (seasonal
adjustment matters more for ratios formed from months within a year, i.e.
short term inflation, but such differences are likely swamped by measurement
error in the CPI).
<p>
Note that the indices <b>cpi</b> and <b>cpiu</b> created by <b>cpigen</b> apply to national trends
in prices of all goods and services purchased by the 9/10 of consumers who are
classified as urban. Many indices are available for particular categories of
goods, e.g. food or clothing or medical care (1998 clothing prices were about
1.5 times 1978 prices, while 1998 medical care prices were about 4 times 1978
prices), or geographic areas, e.g. New York or large northeastern cities or
small southern cities (large northeastern cities tend to have prices nearly
twice as high as small southern cities). See Stewart and Reed (link above) or
http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_16
http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_19 for more.
<p>
For indices not in the CPI family, see e.g.
http://www.bea.gov/papers/pdf/cpi_pce.pdf and
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/AWI.html.
<p>
The variables <b>cpi</b> and <b>cpiu</b> created by <b>cpigen</b> are normalized to 2000 dollars in
annual data, or December 2000 dollars in monthly data.  To turn nominal income,
say, into real income measured in 2000 dollars, simply divide <b>income</b> by <b>cpi</b>.
To turn nominal income into real income measured in 2005 dollars, first divide
<b>income</b> by <b>cpi</b>, then multiply by the value of <b>cpi</b> in 2005.  The idea is, what
cost a dollar in 2000 cost about 1.13 in 2005, so a dollar of income in 2005
made you about as well off as 88.5 cents of income in 2000.
