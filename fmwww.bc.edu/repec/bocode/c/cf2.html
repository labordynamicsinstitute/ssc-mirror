Compare two datasets

        ^cf2^ varlist ^using^ filename [^,^ ^v^erbose ^id(^varname^)^]

Description
-----------
<p>
^cf2^ is a slight variation of ^cf^ to list the observations where differences 
exist.  Option ^verbose^ must be specified to obtain the listing.  Like ^cf^,
^cf2^ compares variables in the dataset in memory (the 'master' data) to the 
corresponding variables in a file (the 'using' dataset).  The variables to be
compared are specified in varlist.  Alternatively, ^_all^ may be specified to
request that all variables be compared.  ^cf2^ returns 0 if the specified 
variables are identical and 9 if there are any differences.  Only the variable 
values are compared.  Variable labels, value labels, notes, characteristics, 
etc. are not compared.
<p>
In the listings, variable names given for the 'using' dataset are a slight 
modification of the actual variable names.  If necessary, they are truncated 
to 7 characters, and all are preceded by an underscore character.

<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^verbose^ reports the result of the comparison variable-by-variable and
    lists the observations where differences exist.  If not specified, only
    the number of differences are mentioned.
<p>
^id(^varname^)^ specifies the record id variable within the master dataset.  
    If specified, this id is displayed as part of the ^verbose^ output.
