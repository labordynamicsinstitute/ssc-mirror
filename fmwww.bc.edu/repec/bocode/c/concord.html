<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>concord</b> computes Lin's (1989, 2000) concordance correlation coefficient
    for agreement on a continuous measure obtained by two persons or methods.
    (The measure was introduced earlier by Krippendorff (1970).) The
    concordance correlation coefficient combines measures of both precision
    and accuracy to determine how far the observed data deviate from the line
    of perfect concordance (i.e., the line at 45 degrees on a square scatter
    plot). Lin's coefficient increases in value as a function of the nearness
    of the data's reduced major axis to the line of perfect concordance (the
    accuracy of the data) and of the tightness of the data about its reduced
    major axis (the precision of the data).  The Pearson correlation
    coefficient, r, the bias-correction factor, C_b, and the equation of the
    reduced major axis are reported to show these components.  Note that the
    concordance correlation coefficient, rho_c, can be expressed as the
    product of r, the measure of precision, and C_b, the measure of accuracy.
<p>
    <b>concord</b> also provides results for Bland and Altman's limits-of-agreement,
    "loa", procedure (1986). The loa, a data-scale assessment of the degree
    of agreement, is a complementary approach to the relationship-scale
    approach of Lin.
<p>
    Finally, two other results are reported:
<p>
        1. The correlation between difference and mean. In one interpretation
        this is a test statistic for a null hypothesis of equal variances
        given bivariate normality (Pitman 1939; also see Snedecor and Cochran
        1989, 192-193).  Alternatively, it is an exploratory diagnostic.  A
        value near zero implies concordance.
<p>
        2. An F test of equality of means and variances. Note that this too
        assumes bivariate normality (Bradley and Blackwood 1989).  See also
        Hsu (1940) and Reynolds and Gregoire (1991).  Nonsignificance implies
        concordance.
<p>
    The user provides the pairs of measurements for a single property as
    observations in variables <i>vary</i> and <i>varx</i>.  Frequency weights may be
    specified and used. Missing values (if any) are deleted in a casewise
    manner.
<p>
    Various associated graphs may be obtained through options.  See below for
    explanations of the options <b>ccc</b>, <b>loa</b>, and <b>qnormd</b>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
    <b>by(</b><i>byvar</i><b>)</b> produces separate results for groups of observations defined by
        <i>byvar</i>.
<p>
    <b>summary</b> requests summary statistics.
<p>
    <b>level(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> sets the confidence level % for the CI; default is <b>c(level)</b>.
<p>
    <b>ccc</b> requests a graphical display of the data and the reduced major axis
        of the data. The reduced major axis or SD line goes through the
        intersection of the means and has slope given by the sign of
        Pearson's r and the ratio of the standard deviations. The SD line
        serves as a summary of the center of the data.
<p>
        <b>ccc()</b> suboption <b>noref</b> suppresses the reference line of perfect
        concordance, y=x.
<p>
        <b>ccc()</b> may also be specified with other options, which should be
        options of <b>scatter</b>. For example, the scheme may be changed by a call
        such as <b>ccc(scheme(lean1)</b>.
<p>
    <b>loa</b> requests a graphical display of the loa, the mean difference, and the
        data presented as paired differences plotted against pair-wise means.
<p>
        <b>loa()</b> suboption <b>noref</b> suppresses the reference line of perfect
        average agreement, y=0.
<p>
        <b>loa()</b> suboption <b>regline</b> adds a regression line to the loa plot
        fitting the paired differences to the pair-wise means.
<p>
        <b>loa()</b> may also be specified with other options, which should normally
        be options of <b>scatter</b>.  For example, the reference line of perfect
        average agreement was generated as <b>loa(yline(0, lstyle(refline))</b>
        <b>yscale(range(0)) ylabel(0, add))</b>.
<p>
    <b>qnormd</b> requests a normal plot of differences.
<p>
        <b>qnormd()</b> may also be specified with options, which should be options
        of <b>scatter</b>. For example, <b>qnormd(title(Normal plot of differences))</b>
        adds a title to the graph.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Comments</u></b>
<p>
    Lin (2000) reported typographical errors in his original 1989 paper that
    affected calculation of the standard error of rho_c. These corrections
    were included in <b>concord</b> in version 2.2.7 (January 2002) when the erratum
    was brought to the attention of the program authors by Dr. Benjamin
    Littenberg.  We thank Dr. Littenberg.
<p>
    Kevan Polkinghorne pointed out a problem with <b>loa()</b>.  Mark Marshall
    pointed out a problem with <b>by()</b> under Stata 9.
<p>
    Dunn (2004) contains a bibliography on related work.  Cox (2004)
    discusses other graphical approaches to this and related problems. Cox
    (2006) discusses concordance correlation and other numerical and
    graphical methods for assessing agreement with various scientific
    examples.
