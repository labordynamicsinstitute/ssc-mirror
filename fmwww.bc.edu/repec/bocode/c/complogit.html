<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<p>
<b>complogit</b> allows for the accurate comparison of coefficients across
groups in a logit equation by automating the calculations discussed in Hoetker 
&gt; (2004; 2007).  
This help file will make little sense without reference to those articles.
<p>
<p>
In its basic application, it performs the requested logit equation on
all observations, on cases where the <i> group</i> variable=0 and on cases 
where it equals 1.  It then performs a logit for all observations, allowing
residual variance to differ across groups. It then tests whether residual 
variation differs across groups using a likelihood ratio and Wald chi-square 
test. Lastly, it uses a likelihood ratio test to test the null hypothesis 
that the true coefficients are the same across groups versus the alternative 
that <i>at least one</i> coefficient differs.
<p>
<p>
Optionally, the user may request a test of test of the null hypothesis that the
&gt;  
true coefficients are the same across groups versus the alternative that 
<i>a specific</i> coefficient differs. To do so, specify the desired coefficient
in the <b>specific</b> option.  Note that this test assumes that all other
coefficients are equal across groups.
<p>
<p>
Optionally, the user may request a test that the ratio of two coeffiients
is the same across groups.  To do so, specify the desired variables in the
<b>numerator</b> and <b>denominator</b> options.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
See above
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
<p>
Version 8 of Stata is required.  There is minimal error checking. 
<b>complogitml.ado</b> contains the maximum likelihood routine and is of little direct
use.  It is based on code contained in Allison (1999). Users may also wish to s
&gt; ee the <b> oglm</b> command
of Richard Williams and his associated papers.
