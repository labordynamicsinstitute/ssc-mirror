Copy characteristics
--------------------
<p>
    ^charcopy^ fromvar tovar  
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^charcopy^ copies the characteristics of fromvar to tovar. Any existing 
characteristics of tovar with names that differ from the names of the 
characteristics of fromvar will be unchanged. 
<p>
^charcopy^ would be useful if you created a new variable from an existing 
variable, and you wished it to have the same characteristics.
