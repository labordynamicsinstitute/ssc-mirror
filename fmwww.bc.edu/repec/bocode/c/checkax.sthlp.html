{synopt :{opth ax:iom(checkax##options:axiom)}} axiom for testing data; default is {bf: axiom(eGARP)}.

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt checkax} allows the user to test whether consumer demand data satisfy certain revealed preference axioms at a given efficiency level.

{pstd}
{opt checkax} is the first in a series of three commands for testing axioms of revealed preference.
The other two commands are {opt aei} (which calculates measures of goodness-of-fit when the data violates the axioms) and {opt powerps} (which 
calculates the power against uniform random behavior and predictive success for the axioms at any given efficienecy level).

{pstd}
For further details on the commands, please see {bf: Demetry, Hjertstrand and Polisson (2020) {browse "https://www.ifn.se/publikationer/working_papers/2020/1342" :"Testing Axioms of Revealed Preference in Stata"}. IFN Working Paper No. 1342}.

{synopt :axiom}  specifies which axiom the user would like to use in testing the data for consistency.
The default is {bf: axiom(eGARP)}. In total, there are six axioms that can be tested: eGARP, eWARP, eWGARP, eSARP, eHARP and eCM.{p_end}

{synopt :efficiency} specifies the efficiency 
level at which the user would like to test the data. The default efficiency level is {bf:efficiency(1)}.
Efficiency must be greater than zero and less than or equal to one.{p_end}

{marker results}{...}
{title:Stored results}

{pstd}
{cmd:checkax} stores the following in {cmd:r()}. Notice that results are suffixed by the {it:axiom} being tested except for results that apply to all axioms, i.e. number of goods and observations, and efficiency level.
