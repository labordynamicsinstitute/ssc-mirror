d 'CHESSPUZZLE': module to solve small chess puzzles
d
d   chesspuzzle gives you a chess position from one of over 200
d historical games, along with information on the game	  and a
d prompt that gives you the task and whether white or black is to
d move. As of now, all puzzles are of the type	  "mate in two" and
d taken from Bill Harvey's website.    You have to type your answer
d in Algebraic notation (e.g., qxh8+) or verbally (e.g., Queen to
d h8). Don't forget the    take, check and mate signs ("x", "+",
d "#") in Algebraic notation. Verbal notation is always the same,
d however. Both    notations are case-insensitive, but do not
d tolerate unnecessary blanks. If you cannot figure it out or have
d to do    something else, type out into the command line and the
d program will stop. If you want to learn the correct answer,	
d type help.
