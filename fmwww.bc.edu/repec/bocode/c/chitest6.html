Chi-square test for univariate frequency distributions
------------------------------------------------------
<p>
    ^chitest6^ observed [ expected ] [^if^ exp] [^in^ range] 
    [ ^, nfit(^#^) count^  ]
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^chitest6^ works on either one or two variables. 
<p>
By default the first variable is taken to be observed frequencies, which must 
be zeros or positive integers. Optionally, the first variable is treated as a 
variable with distinct values to be counted: the observed frequencies are then 
used in a chi-square test. 
<p>
The second variable, if specified, is taken to be expected frequencies under 
some hypothesis, which must be positive. If the second variable is not
specified, the expected frequencies are taken to be equal, i.e. equal to
the mean of the observed frequencies.
<p>
The display includes the Pearson chi-square statistic and its P-value
for a test of the hypothesis, the likelihood-ratio chi-square statistic
and its P-value, observed frequencies, expected frequencies, classic
residuals (observed - expected), and Pearson residuals, defined as
(observed - expected) / sqrt(expected).
<p>
Any cells with expected frequencies less than 5 are flagged.

Options
-------
<p>
^nfit^ indicates the number of parameters that have been estimated from
    the data. This number will be subtracted from (number of cells - 1)
    to give the number of degrees of freedom. The default is 0.
<p>
^count^ instructs ^chitest6^ to count the single variable specified, which 
    is treated as a categorical variable.
