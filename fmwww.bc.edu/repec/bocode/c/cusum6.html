Description
-----------
<p>
^cusum6^ calculates and graphs the cumulative sums (CUSUM) of the recursive
residuals and their squares from the regression specified by "varlist".  Each
graph includes a 95 percent confidence band.
<p>
^cusum6^ is for use with time series data.
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^noc^onstant eliminates the constant from the regressions.
<p>
^nop^lot suppresses the graphs.
<p>
<p>
Other options
-------------
<p>
The CUSUM statistics and the confidence bands can be stored for later use.
The options for storing these variables are
<p>
    CUSUM information
    -----------------
<p>
    ^rr^(varname) stores the recursive residuals.
    
    ^c^s(varname) stores the CUSUM.
<p>
    ^l^w(varname) stores the lower limit of the confidence band.
<p>
    ^u^w(varname) stores the upper limit of the confidence bankd.
<p>
<p>
    CUSUM of squares information
    ----------------------------
<p>
    ^c^s2(varname) stores the CUSUM of squares.
<p>
    ^lww^(varname) stores the lower limit of the confidence band.
<p>
    ^s^qline(varname) stores the reference line.
<p>
    ^uww^(varname) stores the upper limit of the confidence band.
<p>
