<p>
      <b>#corevars</b> is the number of core variables (to be retained in all
                regressions).
<p>
      <b>#testingvars</b> is the number of testing variables (to be systematically

<p>
      <b>options</b> are additional output options. All return variables [e(name)]
                can be specified with a space between them. Default (=none).
<p>
      <b>filename.txt</b> is an option for specifying the name of the output file.
                     Note, that it must have the ".txt" extension.  Default
                     (=<i>result.txt</i>). The table file will get the name
                     table_<i>filename.txt</i>. If <i>filename.txt</i> already exists
                     <b>checkrob</b> will end with an error message.

      <b>noisily</b> displays the output for each regression. Default (=quietly).
<p>
      <i>estimation command</i> can be any single equation estimation command and
                         some 2-equation estimation commands where the second
                         equation is fixed (such as heckman or heckprob with
                         a fixed (unaltered) selection equation in all
                         regressions).
                         <i>Note:</i> the order of the explanatory variables is
                         important for <b>checkrob</b> to work properly. First
                         should the core variables be specified and only
                         thereafter the testing variables (see <b>Examples</b>
                         below).
                         A full set of options supported by the estimation
                         command can be applied to each estimation (e.g.
                         weights, cluster, in range, if etc.)
<p>
<p>
      <b>checkrob</b> supports survey settings via the svy: prefix (see also help
                         svyset).
<p>
      <i>OBS...OBS</i> <b>checkrob</b> only does limited syntax checking. Thus, the user
                should check the prerun explanation by <b>checkrob</b> of what it is
                about to do carefully.
<p>
                                
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>checkrob</b> estimates a set of regressions where the dependent variable is
    regressed (with whatever method is specified in <i>estimation command</i>) on
    the <i>core</i> variables - which are included in all regressions - and all
    possible combinations of the <i>testing variables</i>. In total 2^<i>#testingvars</i>
    regressions are generated. For each regression the coefficients, their
    standard errors and optional estimation return variables (ereturn list)
    are recorded in comma separated format in the file named <i>filename.txt</i>.
    This file can be accessed after <b>checkrob</b> has run with a standard text
    editor. Further, <b>checkrob</b> produces a second text file table_<i>filename.txt</i>
    including the following statistics for each <i>core</i> and <i>testing</i> variable:
    maximum (Max), minimum (Min) and average value (Mean) of the coefficient
    over all regressions, average standard deviation (AvgSTD), share of
    regressions where the coefficient is significant (PercSigni), share of
    regressions where the sign is positive (Perc+), respective negative
    (Perc-), the average t-value (AvgT) and the number of times the variable
    was included in the regressions (Obs) (this might differ between core
    variables (and between testing variables) if a variable is sometimes
    dropped. For each variable the average over optional estimation return
    variables in these regression where the variable featured is also
    reported.
<p>
    The table will look like this (recorded in comma separated form):
<p>
                             table_<i>filename.txt</i>

    <b>checkrob</b> is a useful tool if you want to check the robustness of
    including/excluding one or more controls in your preferred specification.
    <b>checkrob</b> was used to produce the robustness results in Barslund et al.
    (2007). See the command rcheck (if installed) by Kenneth L. Simons for a
    similar procedure, however rcheck cannot handle multiple equation such as
    the heckman estimation command.

<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
        <b>. checkrob</b> <i>#corevars</i> <i>#testingvars</i> [options] [filename.txt] [noisily]
            : <i>estimation command</i>
<p>
        <b>. checkrob 2 3: reg wage education experience age educspouse children</b>
          Here education and experience are core variables; age, educspouse
          and children are testing variables.
<p>
        <b>. checkrob 1 4: reg wage education experience age educspouse children</b>
          Here education is the only core variables; experience, age,
          educspouse and children are testing variables.
<p>
        <b>. checkrob 1 4: reg wage education experience age educspouse</b>
          <b>children, cluster(ea)</b>
<p>
        <b>. checkrob 2 2 output.txt noisily: reg wage education experience age</b>
          <b>children if children&gt;4, cluster(ea)</b>
