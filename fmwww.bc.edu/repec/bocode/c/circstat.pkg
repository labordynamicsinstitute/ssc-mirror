d 'CIRCSTAT': modules to calculate circular statisticsdd circstat.zip contains some Stata programs for circulard statistics. Circular	data are here compass or other directions,d usually measured in degrees from  North or some other referenced direction. The fact that 0 degrees and 360  degrees ared identical, so that for example 180 degrees is not a sensible meand  of 1 deg and 359 deg, provides one illustration that somed special statistical  methods are required for analysis ofd circular data. There are 15 programs, each  with its own helpd file, together with a overall help file circstat.   New features,d January 1999: circsumm has been extended to include a confidence d interval option. circksm has been renamed circxsm. There is a newd circysm. A  bug has been corrected in circdplt and circrplt.d circsumm has an extra option.  There is a new circcomp.  circhistd with the histplot option depends on previous installation of d histplot, barplot and genfreq, all posted on this list.  circysmd depends on _gatan2, ditto. dd Author: Nicholas J.
