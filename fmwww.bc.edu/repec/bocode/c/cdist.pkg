d 'CDIST': module for counterfactual distribution estimation and decomposition of group differences
d
d  cdist estimates counterfactual distributions using methods
d suggested by Chernozhukov et al. (Econometrica 81:2205â€“2268,
d 2013). The unconditional (counterfactual) distributions are
d either obtained by distribution regression using logit models or
d by a linear quantile regression process .Optionally,
d counterfactual decompositions of group differences can be
d obtained.
