{title:Description}

{pstd}Establishing a competency standard for when a certain level of expertise 
is reached by identifying cut-off points on different performance measures based 
on rating scores or simulator metrics is an important issue in competency-based 
learning.

{pstd}One method to set such standards, is {bf:the contrasting groups' standard 
setting method}. 
It is a participant-based method where the performance of a certain procedure 
is evaluated between participants of different expertise levels, e.g., novices 
and experts.

{pstd}Using the contrasting groups' method, the cut-off point is set by 
identifying the intercept of two normally distributed curves that represent the 
score distributions of the groups defined by their level of expertise. 
After a pass/fail score is defined, the percentage of false positives and 
negatives can be calculated to explore the consequences of the test.

{pstd}Traditionally, these false positives and false negatives are calculated 
based on the observed number of individuals who passes or fails a test. 
However, validity studies often include only a small number of participants. 
These small numbers make the rate of false positives and false negatives 
sensitive to outliers.

{pstd}Instead, using the normally distributed curves that represent the score 
distributions of the groups defined by their level of expertise, the theoretical 
false negatives, and theoretical false positives can be calculated.

{pstd}What is new in {cmd:cgssm} and {cmd:cgssmi} is that the cut-off is found 
using an exact formula based on solving a polynomial of first or second 
order degree.
