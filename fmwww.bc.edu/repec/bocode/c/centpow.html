<b><u>Network Centrality and Power</u></b>
<p>
        <b>centpow</b> <i>filename</i> <b>,</b> [ <b><u>norm</u></b><b>alize</b> <b>beta(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> <b>saveas(</b><i>filename</i><b>)</b>]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>centpow</b> creates a new dataset containing the degree centrality,
    alter-based centrality and power, and beta centrality and power for each
    node in a symmetric network described by <i>filename</i>.
    [NOTE: This command does not affect the data in memory.]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
    <b>normalize</b> Requests that each measure be normalized using the approach
        described by Bonacich (1987).
    <b>beta(</b><i>real</i><b>)</b> Specifies the value of the <i>beta</i> parameter used to compute beta
        centrality and power (must be positive).  [Default = .995 * 1/largest
        eigenvalue; this makes beta centrality roughly equivalent to
        eigenvector centrality.]
    <b>saveas(</b><i>filename</i><b>)</b> Specifies the name of the new file containing the
        centrality and power scores.  The default is <i>centpow.dta</i>.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Input</u></b>
    <i>filename</i> must be a comma-delimited file containing a square, symmetric
    matrix.  The matrix entries may be either binary or valued.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Output</u></b>
    Each vector of scores is saved as a variable, with the observations in
    the same order as the rows and columns of the input matrix.
<p>
    Degree centrality is defined as a node's total number of connections, and
    is saved as the variable <i>degree</i>.
<p>
    Alter-based centrality and power are extensions of degree centrality in
    which each node's score is based on the degree centrality of the nodes to
    which it is connected.  Alter-based centrality is defined as the sum of
    the degree centralities of a node's alters, and is saved as the variable
    <i>altercent</i>.  Alter-based power is defined as the sum of the inverse degree
    centralities of a node's alters, and is saved as the variable <i>alterpow</i>.
<p>
    Beta centrality and power are saved as the variables <i>betacent</i> and
    <i>betapow</i>, respectively.  These measures are conceptually similar to
    alter-based centrality and power, and often yield similar results.
    However, they are computationally distinct (see Bonacich 1987) and are
    subject to several assumptions:
<p>
        (1) The network contains no disconnected components,
<p>
        (2) The largest eigenvalue is substantially larger than the 2nd
        largest eigenvalue,
<p>
        (3) The absolute value of <i>beta</i> is less than the reciprocal of the
        largest eigenvalue.
<p>
    If any of these assumptions is violated, the command will issue a
    warning, but will still compute the measures.
