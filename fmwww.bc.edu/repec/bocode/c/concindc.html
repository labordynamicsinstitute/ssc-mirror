<b><u>Estimating concentration index with grouped and microdata: categorical/actual w</u></b>

    where:
<p>
    <i>welfarevar</i> is the welfare variable to be used (can be categorical or
    continuous but must be ordered. Midpoints are permissible), required.
<p>
    <i>Sigmavar</i> is the provided standard error of group means. The default is to
    estimate the group means with microdata (the correct way to do when
    microdata is used) and assume they are zero with grouped data if they are
    not provided.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    <b>concindc</b> computes the concentration index (CI) for micro data with a
      categorical welfare variable or grouped data. See Kakwani, Wagstaff and
      van Doorslaer (1997).  Note that although it was originally designed
      for microdata with a categorical welfare variable, it can handle
      grouped data and microdata with actual (not categorical) welfare
      variable. They could be treated as a special case of microdata with
      categorical welfare measure:  there is only one observation for each
      category. For grouped data, since the program can handle frequency
      weight, the group sizes can essentially be treated as frequency
      weights. The program also can use standard error of group means of the
      health outcome if supplied.  If not, it will be estimated as the
      standard deviation of health outcomes.

<p>
<b><u>Formulas</u></b>
<p>
    The concentration index is computed as:
<p>
                  C = 2*Sum[f_t*miu_t*R_t]/miu -1
<p>
<p>
    f_t is the population share of the welfare group t the individual belongs
    to
<p>
    miu is the overall mean
<p>
    R_t his fractional rank in the socioeconomic distribution
<p>
    miu_t is the group mean
<p>
    Standard errors of C are obtained by a "covariance" or "formula" method:
<p>
<p>
                  Var(C) =  (sum[f_t*(a_t)^2] -(1+C)^2)/n 
                               + sum(f_t*(sigma_t)^2(2*R_t-1-C))^2/(n*miu^2)
<p>
    where:
<p>
<p>
<p>
                  a =  ( 2*R_t- 1 - C)*miu_t/miu + 2 - q_(t-1) - q_t
<p>
    and:  q_t = sum-(i from 1 to t)-(miu_i*f_i)
<p>
    is the ordinate of the concentration curve L(p), and q_0 = 0.
<p>
    and:  sigma_t is the provided or estimated standard error of group means.
