<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<p>
<b>cvxhull</b> identifies points defining the convex hulls of a group of
points in two-dimensional space. Each hull is defined by two lines
joining the bottom-left point to the top-right point. The data are
sorted within the routine but <i>sortpreserve</i> returns the data to
their original order after the call, whether or not it was completed.
The routine may be called repeatedly to calculate a variety of hulls.
<p>
Two new variables may be added to the dataset for each level of hull that 
is defined and retained.  Default varnames start with _cvxh, but you can
change this prefix.  The "y" coordinates for each line are returned as 
_cvxh1l &amp; _cvxh1r, _cvxh2l &amp; _cvxh2r, etc.  
<p>
Other returned variables are: 
_cvxhgrp if a group variable was defined, containing integers 1,2,3 etc 
corresponding to group membership; 
_cvxhhull containing the index number of the hull for ...; 
_cvxhcnt containing minimum and maximum counts of the number of points 
comprising that hull;  
_cvxhpts identifying all points lying on a hull at level k, by having k
as its value for that observation.  This may be useful for choosing points
for labelling by cvxplot.
<p>
Two counts are returned for each hull: the minimum count is the 
number of sides or vertices, returned in the "bottom left" element and 
matched by a positive hull number; and the maximum count is the number 
of points lying on the hull, returned in the "top right" element and matched 
by a negative hull number.  (Single-point hulls return only the first.)
<p>
In addition to the returned variables, the routine uses ten internal
temporary variables (plus another for sortpreserve).  All the variables
named or implied in the previous paragraphs will be dropped at the start
of the program. If the program is broken in on, some of the returned
variables may have been created. 
<p>
It has been suggested that counts of points in successive hulls can be used 
as analogues to the distribution function of a single variable.  The counts 
can be inspected by
<p>
   tab  _cvxhgrp _cvxhhull [fw=_cvxhcnt]
<p>
or, if no group variable was specified (and selecting the minimum counts), 
<p>
   tab  _cvxhhull [fw=_cvxhcnt] if _cvxhhull&gt;0
<p>
These counts can be put in order by an auxiliary routine <b>cvxindex</b>
that sorts the values from _cvxhhull and _cvxhcnt to create new variables
_cvxh&lt;G&gt;mindex and _cvxh&lt;G&gt;maxdex, where &lt;G&gt; represents the group number
from _cvxhgrp.  The counts are returned as the 1st, 2nd etc elements of
each variable, so no longer necessarily correspond to the group variable.
There are, however, no formulae for the expected values of these counts but
they may be found for any distribution by running <b>simulate</b>.
<p>
Unless the nograph option is used, the command will draw a scatterplot with 
the hulls joined.  Plots may be drawn separately from the call using the 
related command <b>cvxplot</b>.  The general graph commands are, of course,
available but the data may need to be sorted or the sort option used (see examp
&gt; les). 
Whether plots of multiple groups on one scatterplot are useful may depend 
on the degree of overlap, and needs to be decided by trial and error.
<p>
The value of complex hulls in describing bivariate datasets is discussed
in Barnett ("Understanding Multivariate Data" 1981, chapter by P J Green).  
A useful survey of algorithms is provided by Hempel on his website 
www.pixelish.com (Convex Hulls - a tutorial Sept 2002).  An earlier Stata 
routine (gr16 by Grey &amp; McGuire) had the disadvantage that it restructured 
the working data. In cvxhull I use a variant of the Jarvis March algorithm, 
which I propose should be named the Hull Football algorithm, on the 
grounds that:
<p>
a) the first code was written on the day England won the Rugby Union World Cup
b) a convex hull is a funny-shaped ball
c) it's a game of two halves, Brian.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Parameters</u></b>
<p>
There must be precisely two variables, forming the y and x of the plot.
Observations that are missing on either variable will not be used.
<p>
The <b>if</b> and <b>in</b> qualifiers act as usual to prescribe a subset of
observations to be considered. When qualifiers are in force, the plot will 
show only observations from this subset. See the <b>group()</b> option for 
an alternative.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
Main options
<p>
<b>hulls(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> either one or two integers.  The first
    defines the maximum level of hulls to be computed for each set of 
    points. Defaults to 1.  
    When the second integer has a value n, only the first and every n'th 
    hull are plotted or retained.
<p>
<b>mdplot(</b><i>integer</i><b>)</b> maximum depth of hulls to be drawn.  
    Defaults to 8 hulls for each group of points.  Further hulls as
    specified by the data and the hulls option will be calculated and 
    retained, but not drawn.
    
<b>group(</b><i>varname</i><b>)</b> separate hulls are defined for each set of
    points identified with a different value of <i>varname</i>. The variable
    may be numeric or string. The group membership is returned as a new
    integer variable, with missing for observations excluded by <i>if</i> or 
    <i>in</i> qualifiers. A table is output showing the equivalence of the 
    integers with the original values.
<p>
<b>select(</b><i>numlist</i><b>)</b> only groups indexed in the list will have
    hulls constructed, but other groups will be plotted as points.  Different
    plots may therefore be obtained by the commands
       cvxhull  y x if group==1
    and
       cvxhull  y x, group(group) select(1)
<p>
    Group values in the numlist do not have to be listed in sorted order.
<p>
<b>means</b> Group means of y-x will be added to the graph as solid triangles.
<p>
<b>scatopt(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> provides a string of options that will be applied
    to datapoints on the scatterplot.  Any scatterplot options can be applied,
    obvious examples being scatopt(ms(i)) to make the points invisible leaving
    only the hull outlines, scatopt(mlab(var)) to mark each point with a value.
    
    Some spurious comments relating to pen styles may be output for hull levels
&gt;  
    when large numbers of hulls are defined.
<p>
    As the scatopt string is the last option added when building the plotting
    command, it is possible to insert a whole extra plotting command.  Eg:
       cvxhull y x, scat("||line x x")
    adds a diagonal reference line.
<p>
<b>prefix(</b><i>string</i><b>)</b> provides a prefix for the names of variables 
    created within the routine.  Variables as generated by cvxhull using this 
    prefix will be dropped when the program is called.  Defaults to _cvxh.
<p>
<b>noretain</b> makes all results internal to the program, so new variables are
    not added to the dataset.  Existing variables of the same names will still 
    be dropped.
<p>
<b>noreport</b> suppresses progress messages output while the program is running.
<p>
<b>nograph</b> suppresses drawing of the graph within the program. 
<p>
<b>saving(</b><i>graph_filename</i><b>[,replace])</b> saves the graph in a .gph file.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    . <b>cvxhull  yvar xvar</b>
    draws a default scatterplot with one convex hull containing all
    the observations.
<p>
    . <b>cvxhull  yvar xvar if year==99</b>
    draws a scatterplot showing only the subset of observations and the
    hull round that subset   
<p>
    . <b>cvxhull  yvar xvar, group(year) hulls(3) ///</b>
           <b>scat(mlab(year) mlabpos(c) msym(i) ysc(r(0,1000)))</b>
    draws a scatterplot with defined y range and each point marked with its
    group value and no symbol. Up to three layers of hull will be computed and 
    plotted for each set of observations sharing a group value. 
<p>
    . <b>cvxhull  yvar xvar, group(year) select(3) scat(mlab(year))</b>
    draws a scatterplot of all groups with each point labelled with its
    group value. A hull is drawn round group 3, where the equivalence
    of 3 and a particular year value is identified in the output table. 
<p>
    . <b>cvxhull  yvar xvar, hulls(15) group(group)</b>
    will plot the maximum 8 hulls for each group.  However, up to 15 hulls 
    (subject to there being data points) will be calculated, and variables 
    _cvxh1l-_cvxh15r etc will be added to the dataset.
<p>
     . <b>cvxhull  yvar xvar, hulls(10 3)</b>
    will plot hulls 1, 4, 7 and 10.
<p>
    See cvxplot for a command to draw hulls using variables saved by cvxhull.
    If you insist on going it alone, the following example gives an idea of
    what is required. It may be convenient to divide this into several lines
    and write the command as a <b>.do</b> file.
        
          local hs "_cvxh1l-_cvxh2r"
          scatter  y x, ms(i) mlab(id,pos(c)) ///
          || line  `hs' x if group==1, sort(x y)  ///
                 clc(black black black black black black) legend(off) ///
          || line  `hs' x if group==2, sort(x y)  ///
                 clc(blue blue blue blue blue blue) legend(off) ///
          || line  `hs' x if group==3, sort(x y) ///
                 clc(black black blue blue green green) legend(off) ///
          || line  `hs' x if group==4, sort(x y) ///
                 clc(black black black black black black) legend(off) ///
          ... etc
