<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>corrtab</b> displays Pearson or Spearman rank correlations for <i>varlist</i>. The default
calculation of individual correlation coefficients is made independently and
thus the display contains the pairwise coefficients.  Optionally, casewise
deletion can be requested. The sample <i>n</i> and a test of independence are also
reported optionally. String variables are automatically omitted from the
analytic processing. Multiple, duplicative <i>varlist</i> designations can be selected
to enable full capture of intended variables; duplicate variables specified in
<i>varlist</i> are removed before processing.
<p>
<b><u>Remarks</u></b>
<p>
<b>corrtab</b> provides a rapid display of correlations formatted for easy reading and
for copying to reports and manuscripts. <b>corrtab</b> is meant for use when the
number of column variables is 8 or fewer, although it could display many more
column variables depending on font and linesize.  The user should experiment.
The number of column variables that will be displayed properly depends also on
the length of the labels in column 1.
<p>
<b>corrtab</b> optionally makes use of advanced labeling systems to provide clear and
useful display suitable for the screen and for word-processors (see below).
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>spearman</b> specifies Spearman correlations. The default is to calculate Pearson
correlations.
<p>
<b>obs</b> adds a line to each row of the display reporting the number of observations
used in calculating the correlation coefficient.
<p>
<b>sig</b> adds a line to each row of the display reporting the significance level of
each correlation coefficient.
<p>
<b>print(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies the significance level for printing of correlation
coefficients. Coefficients with significance levels larger than <i>#</i> are left
blank. <b>print(10)</b> or <b>print(.1)</b> would list only coefficients significant at the
10% level or better.
<p>
<b>bonferroni</b> makes the Bonferroni adjustment to calculated significance levels.
This affects printed significance levels and the <b>print()</b> option.  <b>corrtab,</b>
<b>print(.05) bonferroni</b> prints coefficients with Bonferroni-adjusted significance
levels of .05 or less.
<p>
<b>sidak</b> makes the Sidak adjustment to calculated significance levels.  This
affects printed significance levels and the <b>print()</b> option.  <b>corrtab,</b>
<b>print(.05) sidak</b> prints coefficients with Sidak-adjusted significance levels of
.05 or less.  {p}<b>vars(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> specifies that the first <i>#</i> variables on the <i>varlist</i>
are to be correlated with all of the variables on the <i>varlist</i>. This produces <i>#</i>
columns of correlations. There is no limit to the number of variables
specified, but a difficult to read display occurs when the number of variables
exceeds the width of the screen. Not specifying <b>vars()</b> results in all variables
being displayed.  {p}<b>sort</b> requests the <i>varlist</i> be reported in sorted order. If
<b>vars()</b> is specified the first <i>#</i> variables will not be sorted.  {p}<b>above(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b>
specifies the minimum absolute level of correlation coefficients to be printed.
Coefficients with smaller coefficients are left blank.  <b>above(.5)</b> would list
only coefficients of 0.5 or greater or -0.5 or less.  {p}<b>cwdeletion</b> removes
observations with missing values in the <i>varlist</i> from the calculations.
{p}<b>vsort()</b> sorts the correlation coefficient in descending order according to a
selected variable in the column list. This option works only when <b>obs</b> and/or
<b>sig</b> are not used. That is, it works for the simple display of coefficients
only.  {p}<b>tlabel</b> makes use of the <b>tlabel</b> system (if used) to provide detailed
labels for column 1 (see below).  {p}<b>clabel</b> places labels in the column names
using <b>char</b> <i>varname</i><b>[varname]</b>, according to <b>list</b>'s <b>subvarname</b> option (see below).
{p}<b>alllabel</b> places labels in columns and rows using <b>char</b> <i>varname</i><b>[varname]</b>,
according to <b>list</b>'s <b>subvarname</b> option (see below).  {p}<b>format</b> Default is %9.3f.
Increase both f and d (%.f.df) to handle large number of observations and/or
increased decimal format.  User-defined labels {p}By default, <b>corrtab</b> uses
variable names for column and row labels.  However, variable names are not
always appropriate or appropriately formatted.  Specific labels for correlation
display create several problems. The primary problem is that column labels must
be short enough that they don't waste display space. Row labels can be longer
and provide more information.  User-defined labels provide the opportunity to
make word-processor-ready tables as well as correlation tables that are easy to
read and work with.  {p} There are two systems available. The first (<b>tlabel</b>)
was first used in the program <b>fsum</b> (see fsum if installed). <b>tlabel</b> user-defined
labels are actually variable characteristics in the form of <b>char</b>
<i>varname</i><b>[tlabel]</b> <i>description</i>.  See help for char. Characteristics (labels) are
saved with the data set.  They can be entered from the keyboard with the <b>char</b>
command. Since such labels will probably be used repeatedly, they can be
entered in a do file or program and called when needed. An example of do file
commands is shown directly below:  {p 4 8}. char haq_disa[tlabel] "HAQ (0-3)"
{p_end} {p 4 8}. char sex[tlabel] "Sex (% male)" {p_end} {p 4 8}. char
age[tlabel] "Age (years)" {p_end} {p 4 8}. char ethorig[tlabel] "Ethnic origin
(code)" {p_end} {p}As an aid, the programs <b>tlabel</b> and <b>tlablist</b> are provided.
{p}The second system uses <b>clabel</b>. In Stata 8, an option was provided to the
<b>list</b> command list to make use of <b>char </b><i>varname</i><b>[varname]</b> to label columns.
<b>corrtab</b> makes use of this option, as well. Examples of labels altered for the
shorter <b>clabel</b> system are:  {p 4 8}. char haq_disa[varname] HAQ {p_end} {p 4
8}. char sex[varname] Sex {p_end} {p 4 8}. char age[varname] Age {p_end} {p 4
8}. char ethorig[varname] Ethnicity {p_end} {p}The dual labeling system is
optional. Its main value is in the circumstance where the same variables and
labels are used repeatedly. In this instance it saves time and improves screen
and word-processor formatting and readability.  Examples {p 4 8}. corrtab
{p_end} {p 4 8}. corrtab price weight mpg displ {p_end} {p 4 8}. corrtab price
weight mpg displ, sig var(2) sort {p_end} {p 4 8}. corrtab price weight mpg
