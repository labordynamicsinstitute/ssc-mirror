Description
-----------
clustpop is a routine to estimate population group assignments using the @clust
&gt; er@ command. 
<p>
The cluster command groups cases based on the values of a variable, or the 
mean/median of a group of variables. However, the group assignments will vary
depending on the random seed that starts off the process.  So if the -cluster-
command is executed many times, it will produce different group assignments.
<p>
In other words, There is population of group assignments from which the -cluste
&gt; r-
command samples a single possibility. Therefore the results from -cluster- are 
&gt; like taking a 
sample (N=1) from a population and using that result as an estimate of the 
group assignment population.
<p>
^clustpop^ runs the -cluster- command many times in order to create a larger sa
&gt; mple.
For each case, the most frequently occuring group assignment is taken as an est
&gt; imate
of the most common group assignment in the population.  The case is assigned to
&gt;  
this group only if the lower bound (at a given alpha) of the population estimat
&gt; e is 
greater than half.  In other words, it must be probable that the most frequentl
&gt; y 
occuring group assignment is the group assignment more than half the time in th
&gt; e 
population.  If this is not so, the group assignment is set to missing.

Output:
-------
Three variables are produced as output:
1. The estimate of the group assignment
2. The proportion of cases that are assigned as in variable 1 above
3. The lower bound of the proportion of cases that are assigned as in variable 
&gt; 1 above

Options: 
--------
^reps(^#^)^ specifies the number of times the cluster command is repeated. 
        The default is 30. 
<p>
^k(^#^)^  specifies the number of groups (see help for the @cluster@ command). 
      The default is 3. 
<p>
^seed(^"string"^)^ specifies the random number seed to use at the start. 
               The default is "123456789" (you can just -set seed- intead). 
<p>
^type(^"string"^)^ indicates the type of averaging (see help for the @cluster@ 
&gt; command). 
               The default is "kmeans". 
<p>
^distopt(^"string"^)^ Specifies how the distance between the cases is calculate
&gt; d (see 
                  help for the cluster command). The default is "L2". 
<p>
^alpha(^0.00-0.99^)^ gives the alpha for the statistical test.  Default is 0.05
&gt; .
 
^dots^ will print a dot for each replication (shows the command is working...)

Other routines called
---------------------
  @matsort@ must be installed for clustpop to function
