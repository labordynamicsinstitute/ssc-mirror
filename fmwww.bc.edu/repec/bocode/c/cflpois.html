Syntax
<p>
cflpois Count Denominator [if] [in] [, ^B^y(string) ^N^(string)  ^M^ult(real 10
&gt; 0000.0)]
<p>
        Where Count      : name of variable giving outcome   
          Denominator: variable containing time at risk
<p>
^Description^
----------
 Cflpois Confidence Limitis for poisson distributed outcome (Stata 6)
<p>
 Clfpois is relevant for overall and stratified (conditional) tabulation of 
 incidence rates based on two variables count and time at risk.
<p>
 This module is almost through testing but ^appropriate caution^ 
 should still be applied until a notice has been given to the stata-list
<p>
 By default observations with missing (.) will be excluded from the calculation
&gt; s,
 but not from the stratified table.
<p>
 The rate is calculated as: Count/Denominator
<p>
Reference:
 Stata ^cii^ routine is used for the actual calculation
<p>
example:
 ^cflpois inj  pyrs , by(hrs_wk)^
<p>
 hrs_wk      N     inj       pyrs     rate        l  a     h 
  1-13     234     47       54433     86.3     62.9  -  115.7  
 14-35     136     38      151370     25.1     17.9  -  34.1  
   36+     298    178      729396     24.4     21.0  -  28.3  
<p>
     t       N    inj        pyrs      rate        l  a    h 
 Total     668    263      935199      28.1     25.0  -  31.9  
<p>
<p>
^Options^
--------
^B^y        Stratify by this (or these) variables. 
^N^         Indicate number of persons on which the calculations are based.
            Default is that each record counts as one person. The number of per
&gt; sons
            is only used to display the observation counts. 
^M^ult      Multiplier for rates. Default 100.000. That is rates are counts/100
&gt; 000 time units.
