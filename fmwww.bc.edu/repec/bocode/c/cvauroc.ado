*Step 1: Set Seed

*Step 2: Divide data into `kfold' mutually exclusive subsets (default: 10)

                exit 198
        }
}
set seed `seed'
xtile group = uniform(), nq(`kfold')

*Step 3: fit the model for each of the k-fold training sets

forvalues i = 1/`kfold' {
qui: logistic `var' if group!=`i'

*Step 4: predict the outcome for each of the k-fold testing sets

qui: predict cv_fit`i' if group==`i', pr
display "`i'-fold.............................."
}

*Step 5: calculate the  AUC using the predicted probabilities for each fold

egen fit = rowtotal(cv_fit*)
replace fit = round(fit,.001)
roctab `1' fit, `detail' `graph'

*Step 6: Optinal table displaying the sensitivity, specificity and roc curve

if "`detail'"=="" {
                     local textdetail ""
}
else {
		local detail "`detail'"
		}
		
if "`graph'"=="" {
                     local textgraph ""
}
else {
		local graph "`graph'"
		}


*Step 7: drop variables created by program xvalAUC

drop cv* 
drop group
//drop fit
end
