d 'CATDEV': modules for interpretation of categorical dependent variable modelsdd There are several methods that can be used to effectivelyd interpret the  results of regression models for categoricald dependent variables. Each of these  methods requires the analystd to complete post estimation computations of the  estimatedd parameters. Generally speaking, the estimated coefficients cannotd be  meaningfully interpreted without additional computations.d This set of additions  to Stata (in the form of ado files) thatd facilitate the interpretation of  results of the followingd models: binary logit, binary probit, ordinal logit,  ordinald probit, multinomial logit, Poisson regression, negative binomiald regression,  and tobit. These commands make it easy to do thed computations for a variety of  methods of interpretation:d predicted outcomes and plots of these outcomes,  discrete changesd in predicted outcomes, partial change in predicted outcomes, d standardized coefficients for variables based on a latentd variable, factor  changes in odds ratios for logit models, andd factor changes in mean counts  for count models. Details on eachd of these methods of interpretation can be  found in my bookd Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent Variablesd  (Sage Publications).  dd Author: J.
