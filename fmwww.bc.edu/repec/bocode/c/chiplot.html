<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
<b>chiplot</b> is an experimental program implementing the nonparametric graphical
assessment of dependence plot described by N. I. Fisher and P. Switzer (see:
Graphical assessment of dependence: is a picture worth 100 tests? <i>The American</i>
<i>Statistician</i> 55(3):233-9, 2001).  Because this is offered as an experimental
program only, no details about interpretation of the plots are given; please
see the original article for guidance.  Note that the matrix form of the plot
is not implemented in this version of the program.
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b>
<p>
<b>hilite(</b><i>exp</i><b>)</b> allows a logical expression to be defined to highlight a subgroup
    of data in the plot.  (This is an extension to the plot described by Fisher
    and Switzer.)
<p>
<b>ci(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b> sets <i>p</i> = <i>#</i> such that approximately 100<i>p</i> % of the (lambda, chi) pairs will
    fall between the plotted dashed horizontal control lines when X and Y are
    independently distributed (the null hypothesis).  The only allowed values
    of <i>#</i> are .90, .95, and .99 (or, equivalently, 90, 95, and 99).  The default
    is .95.
<p>
<b>sample(</b><i>%</i><b>)</b> allows a random subsample of the data to be selected for processing.
    The <i>%</i> given to <b>sample()</b> should be a value in the range: 0 &lt; <i>%</i> &lt; 100.  If
    <b>hilite()</b> is specified, the highlighted and non-highlighted subsets will be
    sampled separatedly to (approximately) yield the specified percentage of
    each subgroup.
<p>
    (Note that this option is offered because processing time for large samples
    is very long -- for example, exceeding 70 seconds on a 300MHz Pentium for a
    file of 8000 observations; this despite optimization of the code in version
    0.0.2 that reduced the time to one-third that of version 0.0.1.)
<p>
<b>graph_options</b> are those of Stata's twoway graph.  With the exception of
    <b>saving()</b>, options are applied equally to both the twoway scatterplot and
    the chiplot, so caution is warranted.
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
 . chiplot mpg weight                       (chi-plot of mpg against weight)
 . chiplot mpg weight if foreign            (same, but only foreign cars)
 . chiplot mpg weight, hilite(price&lt;5000)   (same, but inexpensive cars
                                 highlighted)
 . chiplot mpg weight, hilite(foreign)      (same, but with foreign cars
                                 hilighted)
 . chiplot mpg weight, h(foreign) sam(50)   (same, but a 50% sample of each
                                 group)
