    <b>stubs(</b><i>char stubs</i><b>)</b> says what stubs should be checked for dependencies. If
        omitted, this uses the <b>valid</b> stub, checking for `like' dependencies
        in the <b>valid_check</b> characteristic, and for variables needed in the
        <b>valid_other_vars_needed</b> characteristic.  If multiple stubs are given,
        then all dependencies from the above two suffixes are used.
