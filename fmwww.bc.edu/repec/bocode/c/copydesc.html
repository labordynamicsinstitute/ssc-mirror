Copy description of variable
----------------------------
<p>
    ^copydesc^ fromvar tovar [ ^, w^arn ^r^estrain ]  
    
<p>
Description
-----------
<p>
^copydesc^ copies the format of fromvar, any variable label of fromvar, 
any value labels of fromvar, and any characteristics of fromvar, so that 
they also pertain to tovar.
<p>
Any attempt to copy a numeric format to a string variable, or vice versa, 
or to attach value labels to a string variable is by default captured 
gracefully. 
<p>
If fromvar has no variable label, the name of fromvar becomes the 
variable label of tovar. 
<p>
<p>
Remarks
-------
<p>
^copydesc^ is primarily for use by programmers. For example, it may be 
desirable that a temporary variable appear to the user as if it were 
one of the variables specified.
<p>
However, interactive uses also occur. For example, tovar might be a 
slightly modified copy of fromvar: an outlier might be placed in 
a separate variable and all values but the outlier in tovar. 
<p>
Some of the code of ^copydesc^ is stolen from the official but 
undocumented command ^_crcslbl^, but the position of the arguments 
is reversed. 
<p>
<p>
Options
-------
<p>
^warn^ specifies that a warning message is to be issued if one 
variable specified is numeric and the other is string.
<p>
^restrain^ specifies that no action is to be taken if one 
variable specified is numeric and the other is string. 
<p>
<p>
Examples
--------
    
    . ^tempvar plotvar^  
    . ^copydesc myvar `plotvar'^
