<b><u>Chi-square test for univariate frequency distributions</u></b>
<p>
        <b>chitesti</b> <i>#obs1 #obs2</i> [...] [ <b>\</b> <i>#exp1 #exp2</i> [...] ] [ <b>, nfit(</b><i>#</i><b>)</b>
                 <b>replace</b> <i>list_options</i> ]
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Description</u></b>
<p>
    The input for <b>chitesti</b> must consist of
<p>
            either a single row of values
<p>
            or two rows of values separated by a backslash <b>\</b>.
<p>
    The first row is taken to be observed frequencies, which must be zeros or
    positive integers. The second row, if present, is taken to be expected
    frequencies under some hypothesis, which must be positive.  These may be
    given either as numbers or as numeric expressions without embedded
    spaces. If the second row is not present, the expected frequencies are
    taken to be equal, i.e. equal to the mean of the observed frequencies.
<p>
    The display includes the Pearson chi-square statistic and its <i>P</i>-value for
    a test of the hypothesis, the likelihood-ratio chi-square statistic and
    its <i>P</i>-value, observed frequencies, expected frequencies, residuals
    (observed - expected), and Pearson residuals, defined as (observed -
    expected) / sqrt(expected).
<p>
    Any cells with expected frequencies less than 5 are flagged.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Options</u></b> 
<p>
    <b>nfit()</b> indicates the number of parameters that have been estimated from
        the data. This number will be subtracted from (number of cells - 1)
        to give the number of degrees of freedom. The default is 0.
<p>
    <b>replace</b> indicates that the observed and expected frequencies are to be
        left as the current data in place of whatever data were there. These
        variables will be called <b>observed</b> and <b>expected</b>.
<p>
    <i>list_options</i> are options of list.
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Examples</u></b>
<p>
    Breiman (1973, p.191) lists the frequencies of the digits 0 ... 9 in the
    first 608 decimal places of pi as 60 62 67 68 64 56 62 44 58 67.
<p>
    <b>. chitesti 60 62 67 68 64 56 62 44 58 67</b>
<p>
    Breiman (1973, p.191) also gives data from one of Mendel's experiments.
    He observed 315 round yellow peas, 108 round green peas, 101 wrinkled
    yellow peas and 32 wrinkled green peas.  According to theory, the
    expected frequencies should be in the ratio 9:3:3:1.
<p>
    <b>. chitesti 315 108 101 32 \ 556*9/16 556*3/16 556*3/16 556*1/16</b>
<p>
    <b>. gen lastdigit = mod(myvar, 10)</b>
    <b>. qui forval i = 0/9 {</b>
    <b>.         count if lastdigit == `i'</b>
    <b>.         local obs "`obs' `r(N)'"</b>
    <b>. }</b>
    <b>. chitesti `obs'</b>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Saved values</u></b>
<p>
    r(k)         number of classes in distribution
    r(df)        degrees of freedom
    r(chi2)      Pearson chi-square
    r(p)         <i>P</i>-value of Pearson chi-square
    r(chi2_lr)   likelihood-ratio chi-square
    r(p_lr)      <i>P</i>-value of likelihood-ratio chi-square
    r(emean)     mean expected frequency
